That’s been our experience.”</p><p>Caplan, who called her husband the “father of the century,” gushed over life with Riley and Alfie — and explained why she and the Dark Heart actor make a perfect parenting match.</p><p>“The division of labor can really fall to the woman in the majority of cases. I definitely could not have worked as much as I’ve worked this year if I didn’t have this partnership with my husband,” <a href=#>the Emmy nominee</a> confessed. “But also, it just wouldn’t be as fun if we weren’t sharing all of it 50-50. We’re pretty good at seeing the funny in stressful situations. I do feel very, very lucky.”</p><p>Caplan — who filmed Fleishman Is in Trouble and the upcoming Fatal Attraction series just months after welcoming her son — pointed out that raising Alfie doesn’t leave a lot of time for any additional passion projects.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have no hobbies; my hobby is him,” she told the outlet, joking that she has “no time for anything.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in September 2017 that the Castle Rock alum <a href=#>married Riley in Italy</a>. They welcomed Alfie four years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloaqvxm6vwKmjmqZdnLa3sdJmqZqqlWLCsbDArZxmp55iurDAx56poaefmXqzrcisoKefXai8r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-scrappy-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Scrappy Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
