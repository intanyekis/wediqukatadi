That could be what it is. But I’m sure a lot of people will be a little confused at first because they have to think that it’s us. They think, ‘Oh, my God! That’s got to be Thelma, J.J. [Jimmie Walker] and Michael [Ralph Carter].’ And then you come in there, and you don’t see anything like that,” she detailed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She continued to explain how she and Walker have minor roles in the new series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1170094820.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I did a little voice for them, but I did not know it was going to be the way it is. I thought it was going to be different,” the 70-year-old elaborated. “It’s just a little here and there. But I think that they did that because they knew what their show was going to be like. So I guess they figured, if you put us in there, it wouldn’t look so bad or whatever.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Good Times is <a href=#>set to premiere</a> on Netflix on April 12 featuring the vocal talents of&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_marsai-martin data-tag=marsai-martin>Marsai Martin</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_jay-pharoah data-tag=jay-pharoah>Jay Pharoah</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_yvette-nicole-brown data-tag=yvette-nicole-brown>Yvette Nicole Brown</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_jb-smoove data-tag=jb-smoove>JB Smoove</a>, Slink Johnson, and Rashida “Sheedz” Olayiwola. 9th Wonder serves as the show’s executive music producer and music supervisor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">\Watch the official trailer below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6S%2FqrPIp5ilZZekvKV506KknqtdmK60wIymnKaalafAbr%2FHmqmeZaKarqTAyKilZpmenrqiwMSdZKudkqS8tXmQa2ptcGZsfXaDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-pairs-a-cowgirl-hat-with-athleisure-in-aspen.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Pairs a Cowgirl Hat With Athleisure in Aspen</span></a>
