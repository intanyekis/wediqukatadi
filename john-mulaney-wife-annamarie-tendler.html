She makes each lampshade entirely by hand using both new and vintage fabrics, trims, and fringe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why she changed her career path?</h2><p>She was in the process of decorating her house and searching for a Victorian lampshade. But unfortunately, she did not find any perfect lampshade that would fit in her house. After intensive searching, she decided to shift her efforts towards creating. She then ordered the DVD after the suggestion of her husband to teach herself how to make lampshades by hand. She accepted that the first one she made was not good and threw it in the dustbin but after some practice, she was happy with her work on the new lamp.&nbsp;She now owns Silk Parlor that sells handmade Victorian lampshades which are mostly one of a kind and vintage for upwards of $1,000.

They collaborated on various projects, such as Mulaney’s Broadway show “Oh, Hello!” and Tendler’s YouTube series “The Other Side”. They also adopted a French bulldog named Petunia, who became a beloved member of their family. Mulaney often joked about his relationship with Tendler in his stand-up specials, praising her honesty, confidence, and creativity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/John-mulaney-wife-Annamarie-Tandler.jpg><p>However, their marriage was not without its challenges.&nbsp;In 2017, Tendler accused actor Ben Affleck of groping her at a Golden Globes party in 2014. She tweeted “I would also love to get an apology from Ben Affleck who grabbed my ass at a Golden Globes party in 2014” and “He walked by me, cupped my butt and pressed his finger into my crack”. She said that she tried to confront him at the time, but he laughed it off and walked away.&nbsp;She also said that she told Mulaney about the incident right after it happened, and he advised her to forget about it.</p><p>In December 2020, Mulaney checked himself into a rehab facility for 60 days to treat his addiction to alcohol. He had been sober for 15 years before relapsing during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that he started drinking again in September 2020, and then escalated to using drugs. He said that he was “out of [his] mind” and that he needed help. He also said that he was “very lucky” to have Tendler as his wife, who supported him throughout his recovery process.</p><p>However, in May 2021, it was announced that Mulaney and Tendler were getting a divorce after six years of marriage. A spokesperson for Mulaney confirmed the news to Page Six, saying “John will not have any further comment as he continues to focus on his recovery and getting back to work”. Tendler also released a statement through her representative, saying “I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage. I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery”. The reason for their split was not revealed, but some sources speculated that it was related to Mulaney’s addiction issues and career ambitions.</p><p>John Mulaney and his ex-wife Anna Marie Tendler announced their divorce in May 2021, after six years of marriage. Shortly after the news broke, Mulaney was seen dating actress Olivia Munn, who was reportedly a longtime friend of his. In a surprising twist, Munn revealed in September 2021 that she was expecting Mulaney’s child. The couple welcomed their son, Malcolm Hiệp Mulaney, on November 24, 2021. Meanwhile, Mulaney and Tendler finalized their divorce in January 2022, ending their relationship amicably. Tendler broke her silence on the aftermath of their split in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, saying that she had reached “the depth of where I could go” and was now looking forward to new possibilities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Trait</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=10.5><tr readability=2><td>Height</td><td>About 5 feet 4 inches (162 cm)&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>50 kg or 110 pound</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Face</td><td>Oval-shaped with high cheekbones and a pointed chin&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Eye</td><td>Brown, almond-shaped, and slightly upturned&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Hair</td><td>Dark brown, wavy, and usually styled in a bob or a bun&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Ear</td><td>Small and close to the head&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Body type</td><td>Slim and petite&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Skin tone</td><td>Fair with a warm undertone&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Accessories</td><td>Often wears glasses, earrings, necklaces, and rings&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Tattoos</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Piercing</td><td>On ears</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGihqKCeYrq2uMCnnLJlp56zpnnAp6WapZGntqZ5056lnaSVp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-kepple-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Hana Kepple | Biography, Makahiki, Net Worth, Bikini Photos, Boyfriend, Xolo, High and Weight, Actin</span></a>
