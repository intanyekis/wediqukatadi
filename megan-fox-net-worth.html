Her controversial Wonderland interview contains descriptions of Bay's sexually-charged direction, where the actor claims that she was merely told to 'be hot' and 'just be sexy' in place of nuanced acting.</p><p>"Fox claimed that her fetishized appearance in the Transformers films was a product of satisfying Bay's interests. She placated the director by gaining [between eight and ten] pounds before filming, as Bay 'doesn't really like skinny actresses.'</p><p>"From her co-workers and relentless media exposure, Fox's body image has been dissected and judged since the minute she became a household name."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox has never outright said she eschewed this "sex symbol" status, but even now, 17 years after her career debut, she has struggled to shake the stereotype.</p><p>She has never truly escaped this "Bombshell" label, as she often receives scripts in which her role would be as a seductress.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:10</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aoc-s-net-worth-alexandria-ocasio_site.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>It Happens To A Lot Of Prominent Women</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>AOC’s Net Worth: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Modest Money Proves Her Mettle</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>AOC’s Cinderella journey in Washington: How one of the youngest Congress members went from underdog to powerful politician.</span><p>In a 2022 Glamour UK interview, the outlet contrasted the real Megan Fox <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with the Hollywood-enforced version of her</a>.</p><p>Notably, the interviewer herself confessed to "underestimating" Megan, buying in to an "almost cartoon-like," media influenced avatar of Fox:</p><p>"But Megan has not always been as celebrated, appreciated or – crucially – understood.</p><p>"Her rise to fame in the early Noughties saw her emerge as an almost cartoon-like sex symbol whose pin-up, all-American good looks garnered her a reputation for some roles that seemed solely to serve the male gaze.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And the public and the media treated her accordingly. I, too, was guilty of underestimating Megan Fox in the past, buying into the sex-symbol narrative and not taking her seriously enough. But no longer.</p><p>"Because, as I learn, Megan has always been outspoken – radically so – intelligent, boundary-breaking and feminist. And in 2009, the same year she filmed <a href=#>Diablo Cody’</a>s cult horror movie, Jennifer’s Body, she spoke out in the media about being relentlessly [sexualized,] and enduring what she called some 'genuinely harrowing experiences in a ruthlessly misogynistic industry.'"</p><p>Moreover, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">critics tend to be harsh</a> towards her work, often falling into the trap of thinking her success is solely due to her looks.</p><p>Back in 2022, TheThings covered this issue, citing the rift with Bay and observing:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Megan Fox often doesn’t get the credit she deserves. Hollywood largely [pigeonholed] her into one-dimensional 'hot girl' characters, and she’s claimed that her acting opportunities are limited due to her appearance.</p><p>"... Fox is infamous for both her acting career and personal life, but her sporadic participation in films does suggest that her roles may have been limited."</p><p>Megan herself has repeatedly tried to shed light on this problem, but she also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">credits it for her resiliency</a> in Hollywood, and said in 2020 of her early career:</p><p>At the time, I would have appreciated some support; I was just stranded in open water on my own for so long. However, that built up so much strength.</p><p>To have to go through a challenge like that, the resiliency that I have and the ability to survive really negative things with no support from outside forces made me a better person. So, I don’t regret it.</p><p>After her excellent performances in criminally underrated movies like Jennifer’s Body, Think Like A Dog, Rogue, and Till Death, Fox is often still not classed a "good actress."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox has been nominated for "Worst Actress" and "Worst Supporting Actress" awards <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous times at the satirical</a> Golden Raspberry Awards, "winning" for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Expendables 4, and Johnny & Clyde.</p><p>One of <a href=#>Megan's strengths is her ability to clap back at haters</a> with confidence, and even humor.</p><p>She's endeavored to never let criticism affect her and always did what she set out to do, both in terms of her career choices and her appearance.</p><p>Her boundaries are so strong that no negative feedback can breach them, making her seemingly invincible.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:02</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-real-reason-living-legend-lana-del-rey-was_site.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Fame Isn't Always Easy</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Living Legend Lana Del Rey Was Snubbed At The Grammys</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Let’s explore Lana Del Rey’s musical influence, her net worth, and the actual reason Del Rey was snubbed (again and again) at the Grammys.</span><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-net-worth-and-income-streams-outside-of-acting><strong>Megan Fox's Net Worth, And Income Streams Outside Of Acting</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/megan-fox-in-red-dress.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, Megan Fox's net worth has been bolstered by significant sums earned through her acting career, including some major paydays.</p><p>As reported by Vulture, she earned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100,000 for her career-defining role</a> in Transformers.</p><p>For the sequel to Transformers, Fox's base salary was $800,000 — but she likely earned more in back-end profits after the movie grossed over $800 million.</p><p>Earlier reported salaries for Megan Fox's initial roles typically hovered around $400,000, but these were from before her breakthrough, and she could easily command $500,000 to $1 million per project.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:15</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/why-wnba-legend-brittney-griner-s-net-worth_site.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Twice As Much Work For Half As Much Money</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why WNBA Legend Brittney Griner's Net Worth Should Be Way Higher</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>WNBA legend Brittney Griner’s net worth is solid - but it is insultingly low for an athlete of her caliber.</span><p>Lately, Fox's name has been in the news for reasons not related to acting — rather, the focus is on the status of her on-and-off relationship with <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly</a>.</p><p>Although Megan prefers to keep their relationship status undisclosed, it hasn't stopped media speculation or outlets offering their thoughts;
