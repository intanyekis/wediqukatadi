He has not been named because he was not arrested or charged with any crime.</p><p>The heist took place inside the Ranchito #4 Taqueria around 11:30 p.m. last Thursday, when a suspect, identified as 30-year-old Eric Washington, entered the business, produced what appeared to be a gun and demanded that all patrons hand over their cash and wallets.</p><p>Chilling surveillance video from the eatery shows customers cowering under tables as the masked and gloved perp, dressed in all black, walks around grabbing their possessions.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The 46-year-old Houston diner, seen on surveillance video fatally shooting a robbery suspect, will go before a grand jury which will decide whether to charge him. <span class=credit>KTRK</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The suspect in the Jan. 5 robbery was identified as convicted criminal Eric Washington. <span class=credit>Houston Police</span></figure><p>As the suspect heads for the exit with his loot, the 46-year-old diner sitting in a booth stands up, pulls out a handgun and opens fire on the robber, causing him to collapse.</p><p>Then, while standing directly over the wounded intruder, the customer shoots him again at point-blank range, as seen in the video.</p><p>The armed good Samaritan then collected the stolen money and belongings from Washington and returned them to their owners before fleeing the taqueria.</p><p>Washington was pronounced dead at the scene. Police later determined that the gun in his possession was not real.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">An attorney for the unnamed armed patron (pictured) argued that his client was in fear of his life and acted in self-defense. <span class=credit>KTRK</span></figure><p>After police issued a public plea asking the armed customer to come forward so they could interview him about the shooting, his attorney released a statement to the station <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC 13</a> defending his actions.</p><p>“In fear of his life and his friend’s life my client acted to protect everyone in the restaurant,” the attorney wrote, stressing that in Texas, “a shooting is justified in self-defense, defense of others and in defense of property.”</p><p>The unidentified diner has since met with prosecutors from the Harris County District Attorney’s Office and with police homicide detectives.</p><p>Once the investigation is complete, the case will be presented to a grand jury, and the man’s attorney said they are “confident the Grand Jury will conclude that the shooting was justified under Texas Law.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Video from the Ranchito Taqueria shows Washington walking into the eatery brandishing what looks like a gun and demanding cash from patrons. <span class=credit>KTRK</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">After the diner shot him multiple times, it was determined that the gun in Washington’s possession wasn’t real. <span class=credit>KTRK</span></figure><p>The lawyer described the incident as “traumatic” to his client, and noted that “taking a human life is something he does not take lightly and will burden him for the rest of his life.”</p><p>Records indicate that the robbery suspect, Eric Washington, had an extensive criminal history and was out on bond at the time of the fatal shooting.</p><p>In 2015, Washington was convicted of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and sentenced to 15 years in prison in connection with the fatal shooting of 62-year-old Hamid Waraich two years prior.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Armed diner and the rest of the patrons fled the taqueria before police arrived. <span class=credit>KTRK</span></figure><p>Washington was released on parole in 2021 after serving less than half of his sentence, but he was back behind bars in mid-December after being arrested for allegedly shoving and scratching his girlfriend.</p><p>Washington was charged in that incident with misdemeanor family violence and was subsequently released on a personal recognizance bond.</p><p>“Eric was an evil criminal that took joy in harassing and robbing innocent families,” Waraich’s son Sean Waraich told the station. “The individual at the taqueria is a true hero.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmamhfmbavsdFmrqGnXai1sMCMnZyanF2prrLBxKugmmWipK%2BjsdFmq6hllpawpnnGq5innF2fwrPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1206301-booker-t-sharmell-favorite-royal-moment-boogeyman.html><span>←</span><span>Booker T &amp;amp; Sharmell Name Their Favorite Royal Moment, Recall Getting Wormed By The Boogeyman</span></a>
