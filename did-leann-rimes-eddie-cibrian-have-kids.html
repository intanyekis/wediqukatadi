The two got together while each was married to their respective partner, which caused plenty of drama—especially because Eddie's ex wound up being a Real Housewife. But what made the situation worse is that Eddie had two young kids when he and his ex split. That same ex said a ton of terrible things about Eddie and LeAnn both, <a href=#>even threatening to kill LeAnn</a> at one point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, fans continued to watch and wait, thinking that Eddie and LeAnn, who claimed they didn't regret leaving either of their marriages, would eventually expand their family. That never happened, apparently despite the pair's hopes that it would.</p><h2 id=eddie-cibrian-had-two-kids-with-his-ex-wife-brandi-glanville>Eddie Cibrian Had Two Kids With His Ex-Wife Brandi Glanville</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/eddie-cibrian-and-leann-rimes-on-extra.jpg><p>Eddie Cibrian was married to Brandi Glanville from 2001 to 2010, though they split sometime before the official divorce date. Eddie and LeAnn got married in 2011, after meeting in 2009 and getting engaged on Christmas Eve 2010.</p><p>While Cibrian was with Glanville, the two had two sons together. Their boys, Jake and Mason, were quite young when their parents split; Jake was around three while Mason was about seven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the way that his marriage ended, Eddie was able to secure shared custody with Brandi, and the two apparently stuck to the custody agreement even through Brandi's grief and vitriol post-split.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Does 'RHOBH' Star Brandi Glanville’s Relationship With LeAnn Rimes Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>In 2017, when asked about how their custody situation was going, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie responded that "It's been great,"</a> seemingly indicating that he and Glanville's drama was finally over.</p><p>At that time, LeAnn and Eddie both spoke about how they enjoyed spending time with the kids, and LeAnn noted how much of an influence having the kids in her life had on her music. As for whether she and Eddie planned to expand their family, it doesn't seem like it was ever in the cards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-leann-rimes-want-more-kids-with-eddie-cibrian>Does LeAnn Rimes Want More Kids With Eddie Cibrian?</h2><p>Given the way <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their love story played out</a> (something that the couple finally seems to be able to be happy about), fans might assume that Eddie and LeAnn would have been in a hurry to have children together. It turns out that wasn't really a priority, as the two have shared over the years.</p><p>When they first began seeing each other, they were both married, so the immediate aftermath of their respective splits (LeAnn got divorced the same year as Eddie) was messy. From divorce proceedings to custody agreements and Brandi's upset (she made the most headlines for dragging LeAnn and her ex), the blended family had a lot going on.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why LeAnn Rimes And Eddie Cibrian Won’t Do Reality TV Again</a></span></p><p>Later, <a href=#>Rimes admitted that she and Cibrian both cheated</a> on their exes, saying, "I hate that people got hurt, but I don't regret the outcome." But she and her new husband seemed to realize that their lives had changed in big ways, with LeAnn admitting that life was busy with the kids, and the two had to carefully plan their time away given that they "have the kids half the time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that LeAnn and Eddie's marriage probably matured quickly—but they did skip a step of having biological kids together.</p><h2 id=how-many-biological-kids-does-leann-rimes-have>How Many Biological Kids Does LeAnn Rimes Have?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar49486746.jpg><p>When it comes to biological kids, LeAnn Rimes currently doesn't have any. That doesn't mean she didn't want them, however. In one interview, LeAnn expressed that she sometimes got baby fever, understandable since she explained she'd met and married the love of her life.</p><p>At the time, Rimes explained, "I'm trying to figure out what it is that stirs it. I haven't figured that out yet, because every once in a while I'll be like, 'What is making me want a baby, like, right now?' I haven't figured that out yet, but it hasn't stuck."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even with the baby fever, the artist wasn't adamant about having more kids, noting, "Maybe one day... I mean, I love my stepkids and I've got plenty on my plate with them. So, I'm cool at the moment."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Are Talking About Brandi Glanville Again</a></span></p><p>By all accounts, it seems that Rimes may not end up giving birth to biological kids with Eddie. Of course, even though Rimes turned 40 in 2022, that doesn't mean she couldn't expand her family through surrogacy or even adoption.</p><p>It seems that amid focusing on Eddie's two boys, and being present parents to them, LeAnn decided that having biological kids wasn't that much of a priority—even if she does catch baby fever every so often.</p><p>Regardless, LeAnn treats Eddie's boys as her own, admitting in an interview that the family not only celebrates Brandi Glanville on Mother's Day but also recognizes Stepmother's Day so that LeAnn can "be celebrated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No word on what Brandi thinks of that particular celebration, but after all the drama with Eddie, she found a different sort of spotlight on Real Housewives—and fans (and critics) are still talking about her all the time. It seems Eddie and LeAnn are fine with staying out of the spotlight, though.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdobKius1mqaKllah6prDDopxmm5mXv6qtzWafmq6VYriqsNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ilkay-gundogans-net-worth-fact-career-awards-biography-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Ilkay Gundogans net worth, fact, career, awards, biography &amp;amp; life story</span></a>
