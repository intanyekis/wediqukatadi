Minutes after sharing his concern about <a class="Ed a" href=#>the billionaire</a>, the 37-year-old man shared a Facebook picture of himself smiling in front of the merchandise section at a Blink-182 concert.</p><p class=fh>In the post's caption, he <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>noted</a> how the post might seem "distasteful." However, he explained that his family would want him to attend the show.
