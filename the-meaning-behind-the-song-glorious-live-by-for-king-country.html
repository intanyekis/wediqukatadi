One such song that has left a lasting impact on me is “Glorious (Live)” by for KING & COUNTRY. I remember stumbling upon this song at a friend’s house and being captivated by its powerful lyrics and uplifting melody. It instantly became one of my favorites.</p><p>The song opens with the beautiful image of shepherds bowing in the moonlight, with angels dancing in the night sky. This imagery sets the tone for a deeply spiritual experience. The lyrics ask, “Can you believe it?” repeatedly, as if urging the listener to truly grasp the magnitude of what is being sung. It’s a reminder that even amidst the ordinary, extraordinary things can happen.</p><p>In the second verse, we are introduced to Mary, whose tears spill on a Savior. This reference to Jesus being born in a manger touches upon the profound humanity and divinity intertwined in this event. It highlights the emotional connection between Mary and her newborn child, emphasizing the depth of love and sacrifice.</p><p>The pre-chorus declares, “For unto us a child is born,” referencing the biblical prophecy of the birth of Jesus. This line not only acknowledges the fulfillment of the prophecy but also serves as a reminder of the profound significance of this event in history.</p><p>The chorus of the song is the heart and soul of “Glorious (Live).” It proclaims that Jesus is the chorus to every song we were born to sing. His presence and influence permeate every aspect of our lives, serving as the rhythm of our hearts. The lyrics invite listeners to let the beat begin and experience the joy and freedom that comes with surrendering to the divine rhythm.</p><p>The repeated refrain of “He’s so glorious” emphasizes the awe-inspiring nature of Jesus’ love and presence. It conveys the wonder and beauty of a relationship with Him, describing it as a miracle that sets people free. The song paints an image of Jesus as a wonder, unlike anything we have ever seen before.</p><p>The bridge of the song shifts the focus to the listeners themselves. It invites us to embrace the wonder of Jesus and offer our praises to Him alone. It acknowledges Jesus as the greatest gift to humanity, reminding us of the immeasurable love and grace He has bestowed upon us.</p><p>“Glorious (Live)” is not just a song; it’s an experience. It invites us to immerse ourselves in the divine presence and be transformed by the overwhelming love of Jesus. It reminds us of the true meaning of Christmas – the miracle of God with us.</p><p>Written by Andy Mineo, Tedd T, Luke Smallbone, and Joel Smallbone, the song showcases the talent and passion of for KING & COUNTRY. Their powerful vocals and heartfelt delivery bring the lyrics to life, making the song even more impactful.</p><p>Released on October 27, 2017, as part of their live album “Christmas | LIVE from Phoenix,” this rendition of “Glorious” captures the energy and spirit of their live performances. The additional editing, engineering, and production by a talented team contribute to the overall excellence of the track.</p><p>In conclusion, “Glorious (Live)” by for KING & COUNTRY is a song that touches the depths of the human soul and invites listeners to encounter the glory of Jesus. Its powerful lyrics, captivating melody, and passionate delivery make it a truly remarkable piece of music. I highly recommend giving it a listen and allowing the song to resonate with your heart and spirit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBpaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmaepaeinry2v4yloK%2BdXZfGbrLOq2SkoZ6ceqS71Kerq7Ff</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ferragamo-story-heres-how-salvatore-ferragamo-became-a-world-renowned-brand.html><span>←</span><span>The Ferragamo Story: Here's How Salvatore Ferragamo Became A World-Renowned Brand</span></a>
