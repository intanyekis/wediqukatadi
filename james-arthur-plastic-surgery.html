The singer has not responded to those Botox speculations but he has admitted to having a nose job and getting veneers to straighten his teeth in the past. James Arthur said that he got plastic surgery on his nose because it was bent and was causing congestion.</strong></p><p>If you feel that <strong>James Arthur</strong> might not be the kind of guy who is conscious about his looks and gets plastic surgery, you are wrong because he is and he has. The <a href=#><strong>singer</strong></a> does not seem to be overly conscious about his appearance. He just wants to take care of his face as he does his voice because one of his dreams is to be a Hollywood film star and so, he thought he needed to readjust his face to make himself more appealing. For that, he got some of his tattoos removed and he also fixed his nose. Lately, he looks like he has had Botox as well.</p><p>Let's talk about James Arthur's plastic surgery in detail!</p><p>You might also like the <strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Mads Lewis</a></strong>.</p><h2>Has James Arthur Had Plastic Surgery?

They believe he has had plastic surgery, <strong>Botox</strong> particularly. He has never talked about having Botox but he has spoken about getting a <strong>nose job</strong> and <strong>veneers</strong> to straighten his teeth.</p><p>In 2017, James Arthur <a href=# rel=noopener>went under the knife</a> to fix his nose though it wasn't just to fix his appearance, it was also because his nose was causing him discomfort. He has been very open about his experience. He even posted a picture of himself during recovery. He shared a picture of himself with his nose covered in bandages and explained that he had had it straightened because he had to after he had had "too many scuffles as a teen."</p><p>Just before James Arthur went in for the op as well, he wrote on Twitter that he was in the hospital waiting to have his nose broke back into place. He only elaborated on his decision to get plastic surgery after he had the operation, warning kids to 'stay out of trouble' because he had to <a href=# rel=noopener>get it fixed due to the many scuffles</a> he used to have when he was a teenager. He joked,</p><p><strong>Stay outta trouble kids.. just had my nose put straight after many years of it being on one side of my face due to one to many scuffles as a teen lol.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/james-arthur-pic2.jpg alt="James Arthur has admitted to getting plastic surgery to fix his nose because it was crooked, and veneers as well. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>James Arthur has admitted to getting plastic surgery to fix his nose because it was crooked, and veneers as well.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The Times</strong></p><p>While fixing his face was the only reason James Arthur gave to explain why he chose to get plastic surgery on his nose when he was in recovery, he had said something different sometime before. He had revealed his plans to get a nose job at the end of 2016 and in an interview with The Sun, the former X-Factor winner said that he had to get an operation on his nose because it was bent and was causing congestion.</p><p>James Arthur also said that his nose was crooked because he used to fight too much when he was young and he had been <a href=# rel=noopener>punched too many times in the nose</a>. He said,</p><p><strong>They are going to break it and put it back in place. It’s all my years of fighting – too much fighting as a young guy. I’ve been punched in the nose too many times. I’ve been putting off the operation.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/james-arthur-pic3.jpg alt="James Arthur is suspected of having Botox because his face looks unusually smooth. houseandwhips.com&nbsp; " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>James Arthur is suspected of having Botox but he has not admitted to anything besides the nose job and veneers.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: NME</strong></p><p>Besides getting plastic surgery to fix his nose, James Arthur has also fixed his teeth and he's been open about his dental procedure as well. He said that he had inherited bad genes, bad teeth and so, the dental work to spruce up his smile was an ongoing thing. He revealed that he had gotten veneers.</p><p><strong>I got my teeth done. It’s an ongoing thing. I am working on them constantly. I got veneers. They moved a bit though so I need to probably get a brace back on for a month again. I was just born with bad genetics, bad teeth. When I got my teeth done, when they finished I got given a special retainer and my dog ate it. I didn’t get another one made for about six weeks and by the time I was back they had all move and two years of work was f***ed up. They have done everything they can to make them look straight without putting a brace back on.</strong></p><p>Besides a nose job and veneers, James Arthur is believed to have had Botox because, in his recent pictures, his face looks very smooth and he does not seem to have skin texture at all. It might be phototuning or some filters but he has been looking that way for sure, which has led to his fans suspecting he had the anti-wrinkle injection. The singer has not admitted to any plastic surgery except the nose job.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGihmqWVqHqivtOhrKtloKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sakshi-mishra-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-601093-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sakshi Mishra Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
