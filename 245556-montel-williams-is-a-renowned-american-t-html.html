The show, which ran for 18 seasons between 1991 and 2008, cemented Williams' place in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=dh>In 1996, he was the recipient of the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host. It was only one of the several honors he received as an extraordinary TV host.</p><p class=dh>Behind his successful show, Williams experienced failed relationships. He has been married three times, with his two previous relationships - Rochele See and Grace Morley - producing four children.</p><p class=dh>The talk show host was married to See from 1982 to 1989, and during their relationship, they bore two daughters - Ashley Williams and Maressa Williams.</p><p class=dh>From 1992 to 2000, Williams was married to Grace Morley. The former couple shares son Montel Brian Hank Williams and daughter Wyntergrace Williams. Seven years after his second divorce, Williams <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/montel-williams-marries/>tied the knot</a> with Tara Fowler, a former flight attendant.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Williams explained that his primary symptom was pain and that he suffers pain every day for 24 hours.</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HIS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DIAGNOSIS</strong></p><p class=dh>Back in 2017, Williams was reportedly preoccupied as a spokesman and businessman. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/02/montel-williams-wife-tara-married-divorced-children-photos-today-photos-age-net-worth/>reportedly advocated</a> for medical marijuana use. His position on this controversial issue stemmed from his health struggles.</p><p class=dh>The <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931354/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Maryland-born talk show host</a> was previously diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a life-threatening neurological disease. It was a huge blow to him, but he was determined to overcome the disease.</p><p class=dh>He tried several medical options, including medicinal cannabis. The talk show host later launched a business that aims to give people who share the same illness access to a medical-grade line of cannabis oil and products.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Williams</a> explained that his primary symptom was pain and that he suffers pain every day for 24 hours. His condition became so unbearable that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprah.com/health/montel-williams-battle-with-ms-overcoming-depression-and-pain/all>he even attempted suicide</a>, putting a gun in his mouth.</p><p class=dh>But he stopped himself thinking that he had small children in the house. He also thought of getting himself run over by a car. But that was until he had an epiphany, saying that he now considers his disease a gift.</p><p class=dh>The talk show host said it was given to him by God for a reason. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprah.com/health/montel-williams-battle-with-ms-overcoming-depression-and-pain/all>said</a> in an interview with Oprah Winfrey: "I go to that place of gratitude. I go to that place of fulfillment and taking advantage of the small things."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrbm1la3quu82tnKVlp565rbXApqpmoaNirm6%2BxKemsKaVmXqiucSroJyZnmLBb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joseph-forte.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Forte</span></a>
