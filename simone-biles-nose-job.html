However, it does not really look like the gymnast has altered her nose in any way. It does not look any different than how it was before. Just more refined and it is most likely due to contour. Simone Biles has never addressed the rumors of having a nose job.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Simone Biles</strong></a> is one of the most skilled and artistic <a href=#><strong>gymnasts</strong></a> in the whole world. There's really no doubt regarding that. Her seven Olympic medals which hold the record for the most won by an American gymnast (tied with Shannon Miller) and is the ninth-most overall, vouch for that. Also, it is clear from the fact that she is the most decorated gymnast in the history of the Gymnastics World Championships (she has won 25 World Championship medals). No wonder she is considered by many to be the greatest gymnast of all time. In 2022, she was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by <strong>Joe Biden</strong>.</p><p>In 2019, Simone Biles became the gymnast with the most World medals (24) and most World gold medals (19) by breaking the record of Vitaly Scherbo with 23 World medals by winning her 24th and 25th (both gold) at the competition in Stuttgart. The female gymnast with the most World all-around titles, she recently won her eighth U.S. Gymnastics title, yet again breaking another record of 90 years held by <strong>Alfred Jochim</strong>.</p><p>She is currently the woman of the moment. And with her recent achievement shining the spotlight on her, people are taking more interest in her personal life. Most notably, there has been a surge in Google searches about her nose job. While many people wonder if she has had a rhinoplasty procedure, others want to know what thoughts she has about the procedure. Let's discuss whether or not Simone Biles has had a nose job!</p><p>Would you also like to read the <a href=#><strong>plastic surgery</strong></a> stories of <a href=#><strong>Jackie Sandler</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Trinny Woodall</strong></a>?</p><h2>Simone Biles' Nose Job: Her Nose Does Not Look Much Different From Before!</h2><p><strong>Simone Biles' </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@simonebiles</a>) fans wonder if she has had a nose job. Some of them also want to know what her thought on the rhinoplasty procedure is and whether or not she has ever thought of having it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/08/simone-biles-pic1.jpg alt="Fans wonder if Simone Biles has undergone a nose job. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Fans wonder if Simone Biles has undergone a nose job.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The Wall Street Journal</strong></p><p>Having won 32 world championships and Olympic medals since 2013, Biles is considered to be the greatest gymnast of all time. There was a debate regarding whether she really was the greatest after she removed herself from several finals at the Tokyo Games in 2021 to safeguard her health. But that couldn't last forever. Especially not after her <a href=# rel=noopener>recent win at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships</a>.</p><p>Simone Biles broke the record by becoming the first American gymnast to win eight national all-around titles. She became the oldest woman to ever win the U.S. Gymnastics Championships at 26. She glowed as she won and all eyes were on her. With the spotlight on her, people after celebrating her win began to scrutinize her looks and started wondering if she had had plastic surgery. They especially wanted to know if she had had a nose job.</p><p>Now, that's very curious that people want to know if Simone has had a rhinoplasty procedure because her nose really has not changed much. I mean, it pretty much looks the same in length and width. It's not narrower than before and thus, it does not appear longer than before. Sure, it looks a little more refined than before but that does not really mean that she has had a nose job.</p><h2>Simone Biles Has Not Had a Nose Job; Her Nose Looks Refined Because of Contour!</h2><p>It could mean that <strong>Simone Biles</strong> does her makeup in such a way as to make her nose look like that. Just take her pictures from when she was younger and her more recent one. In the comparison picture, you will notice that her nose does not really look much different. There's no change in the shape of it. It just looks more refined. That certainly does not require anyone to have a nose job. All it needs for that kind of refinement is proper contour.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/08/simone-biles-pic2.jpg alt="Simone Biles' nose probably looks more refined because of contour, not plastic surgery. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Simone Biles' nose probably looks more refined because of contour, not plastic surgery.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: BET</strong></p><p>Also, why would anyone ever think that she has altered her nose when it does not really fit the traditional beauty standards? When celebrities get a nose job, they get it to make it look more aesthetic and to fit more into the conventional beauty standards. But Simone does not really have the typical thin, small, and narrow nose that is considered beautiful. She has a wide nose, the kind of nose that people consider to be not beautiful and change. If she had gotten plastic surgery, wouldn't she change that? You can tell that she has not had a nose job just from that.</p><p>Also, many people want to know what Simone Biles' thoughts on rhinoplasty are. To those, it does not look like she is much interested in changing her nose to make it look like what society deems beautiful, she is more focused on her gymnast. So, it seems that she is not really considering having a nose job. She does not ever have to consider altering her nose because she has a wide nose and she looks beautiful in that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiqoqWfo7JursilnKxlnqTApnnJqJlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vivica-a-fox-inside-a-day-in-my-life.html><span>←</span><span>Vivica A.
