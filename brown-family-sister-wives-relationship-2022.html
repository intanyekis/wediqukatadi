It seems like Robyn and Meri are fairly close as they made the meal together.</p><p>Kody wasn't happy, though, and he told the camera, “I would never again, for the rest of my life, ever want to have wives sharing a kitchen. There is a tendency from what I’ve seen to be this vying for power and position or relinquishing power and position to get along... I never want to see my wives sharing a kitchen ever."</p><p>Despite what Kody said, the wives had fun, with Robyn saying, “Meri and I actually work really well in the kitchen together. I don’t know how it would be if we lived together and shared a kitchen, but when we work together for holidays, we actually work really well together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meri and Janelle don't seem to have the best relationship, however.
