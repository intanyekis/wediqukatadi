They have become a status symbol, and people keep a close eye on what their favorite celebrities are driving. <a href=#>Celebrities with multi-million dollar fortunes</a> spend thousands of dollars buying the most sought-after cars. While some prefer to own vintage cars in their collection, others buy the most high-tech and customized cars they can get their hands on. As celebs try to <a href=#>expand their collection with luxury cars</a>, Lamborghini has become a must in the car collection. From models and musicians to athletes and actors, every celebrity has a Lamborghini in the garage.</p><p>Celebrities have paid extra to customize their luxury Italian supercars with the best accessories and equipment. Some make changes to the interior while others change the outlook of their cars. Let’s take a look at the nicest and most expensive Lamborghinis owned by celebrities.</p><h2 id=chris-brown>Chris Brown</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Brown has a Goku tattoo and necklace to commemorate Dragon Ball Z, and he completed the set after customizing his Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce with a Dragon Ball Z theme. The Dragon Ball Z hero is painted on the hood with a splash of crimson red, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto Evolution</a>. The customized SV cost him a whopping $400,000.</p><h2 id=kanye-west>Kanye West</h2><p>Kanye West is known to make a lot of quirky decisions. When he purchased the Lamborghini Urus in 2019, the rapper decided to modify it himself. The customized Urus has a cream-colored matte wrap with monoblock wheels. The interior is splashed in bright blue leather with grey accents. The starting price of the Urus is $200,000. However, the customized SUV cost a couple thousand more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is What Makes Kanye West's $57 Million Malibu Mansion 'A Livable Art Piece'</a></span></p><h2 id=justin-bieber>Justin Bieber</h2><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber purchased</a> his Lamborghini Aventador in 2012 when he was just 18 years old.

The limited-edition model of the Pearl Capsule collection has a starting price of $220,000.</p><h2 id=sean-combs>Sean Combs</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Sean Combs, better known as Diddy</a>, is a Grammy-winning rapper and record producer.
