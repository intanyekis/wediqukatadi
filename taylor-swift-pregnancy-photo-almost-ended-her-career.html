We'll take a closer look at what the reports were saying at the time, and how Taylor Swift felt about it all.

The publication posted a photo on the front cover of their magazine, showing Swift with a tiny bump while wearing a black dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine likely made a fortune from the headline, but for Taylor Swift, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she found herself struggling with an eating disorder</a>. Swift opened up with Variety about the impact of the photo.</p><p>“I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,” she says. “And the headline was like ‘Pregnant at 18?’ And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat. So I just registered that as a punishment. And then I’d walk into a photo shoot and be in the dressing room and somebody who worked at a magazine would say, ‘Oh, wow, this is so amazing that you can fit into the sample sizes."</p><p>Swift continues, "Usually we have to make alterations to the dresses, but we can take them right off the runway and put them on you!’ And I looked at that as a pat on the head. You register that enough times, and you just start to accommodate everything towards praise and punishment, including your own body.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-11t133815-961.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-23t163854-959.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>David Letterman Worried He Was Going To Offend Taylor Swift By Revealing What She Smelled Like During Their Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Letterman's reveal of what Taylor Swift smelled like wasn't what the artist and the fans were expecting.</span><p>During the Miss Americana documentary, Swift would go on to open up about other struggles, which included leaving the music scene completely after the tag #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty started trending.</p><p>Thankfully, she was able to deal with these awful issues, and make a return for all the fans that support her.</p><h2 id=other-disturbing-reports-stated-that-taylor-swift-had-gained-weight-because-of-her-eating-habits>Other Disturbing Reports Stated That Taylor Swift Had Gained Weight Because Of Her Eating Habits</h2><p>The speculation over Swift's apparent bump was truly out of hand.

Given her tone, Taylor was clearly annoyed at the time by the speculation. She said, "They're very creative saying that I'm pregnant, which is impossible and impossible. It's so crazy when you spend your entire life trying to be a good person and role model, and people make things up about you."</p><p>The interview moment can be relived below.</p><p>Swift would go on to reveal with Variety that taking photos haunted her after that moment for years.</p><p>"It’s only happened a few times, and I’m not in any way proud of it.
