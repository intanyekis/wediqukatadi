The star has said in the past that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she blames herself for many of her failed relationships</a>. But in reality, the only difference between the actress and any other half of a couple is that she's famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Living out her love life in the spotlight can't be easy, and fame means that every relationship issue is amplified in the media. Fortunately, Gwyneth also has other relationships she can discuss -- and joke about -- without sharing her private business with the world.</p><p>All of her high-profile partnerships aside, Gwyneth Paltrow has also kissed a lot of actors on-screen. It's all in a day's work, right?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow/Brad Pitt & 9 Other Celeb Couples Who Almost Got Married</a></span></p><p>And the actress confessed that there's one actor who is the best kisser of them all. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Charlotte Observer</a> quoted, Paltrow explained that she had a "little cameo" in a film with one big-name actor, and it turned out that was the best smooch of her life.</p><p>In the third Austin Powers film, Paltrow had a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo -- she was "Dixie Normous" in a scene with Tom Cruise. She "got to make out with Tom Cruise" said Gwyneth, and the experience was fantastic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said of the short scene: "He was an amazing kisser!"</p><p>However fans might feel about Tom, he&nbsp;has been in the industry for a long time. Which means he's had plenty of opportunities to perfect his on-screen lip-smacking, so it's not that surprising that Gwyneth says he's her best-ever kiss.</p><p>At the same time, it's a little awkward for fans because Tom isn't&nbsp;exactly a heartthrob to the younger generations the way he was to older moviegoers. The 58-year-old actor is still headlining plenty of big-name films and the 'Mission Impossible' franchise -- and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it's made him millions</a>. But times have changed for Tom. That is to say, most of his recent co-stars probably don't go around bragging about having kissed him on camera.</p><p>An on a side note, Gwyneth's confession&nbsp;was back in 2011. So clearly, there's no offense meant to her current hubby, Brad Falchuk. Or even, for that matter, her ex Chris Martin (they were married the year after that 'Austin Powers' moment).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But thinking back on all of Paltrow's appearances in romantic and other films, she's kissed a whole lotta guys both on screen and off. It must have made Tom's day to hear that she thought so highly of him -- especially in a film like 'Austin Powers.' It's not the most romantic scene they could've had, but hey, at least the lip-to-lip action wasn't awful for the stars involved!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Shorter: Tom Cruise Or Bruno Mars?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnMS6usStn2aokaHBs7vWZquhoZ6gwG610maZnqukYriqv9KeqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./explaining-the-ending-of-heartstopper-season-2-including-cast-release-date-plot-and-where-to-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Explaining the Ending of Heartstopper Season 2, Including Cast, Release Date, Plot, and Where to Wat</span></a>
