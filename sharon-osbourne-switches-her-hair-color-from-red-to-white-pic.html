She explained to me that she wanted to do this transformation a long time ago but every time she attempts it ends up with a disaster.”</p><p>He went on to point out that she was tired of getting her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair done</a> every week – we can only imagine that type of commitment! — but kept it up due to her busy TV schedule hosting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Talk</a>.</p><p>“I didn’t promise Sharon anything but I told her I will try my best,” he continued. “It took me a total of 8 hours from start to finish to get her to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">platinum blonde</a> so she doesn’t have to be committed to coloring her hair once a week anymore. I had great time spending my day off with this gorgeous, humble, and sweet soul.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also shared the products he used to get this finish, which include Wella Blondor, Olaplex toner and number 2, Pravana lift treatment and Framar coloring tools.</p><p>Osbourne is the second A-lister to make this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dramatic change</a> this year.
