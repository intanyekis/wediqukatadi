Now, it’s time to share their joy with additional family friends. Here’s everything to know about Ben’s Georgia home, as the new couple prepares to host their second wedding.</p><h2>Inside Ben’s Georgia Home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-wedding-georgie-mansion-ss-backgrid-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ben’s estate, the very definition of “Southern charm,” is located in Riceboro, Georgia, just outside of Savannah. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Homes and Gardens</a>, the 87-acre property overlooks the beautiful North Newport River on Hampton Island. Emerald green, sweeping, and isolated, it’s the ideal setting for a romantic late summer celebration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-wedding-georgie-mansion-ss-backgrid-post3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The estate reportedly has no fewer than three houses. At 6,000 square feet, a main residence has three bedrooms and five bathrooms. Another, larger house dubbed the “Oyster House” is a massive 10,000 square foot building with five regular bedrooms, three master suites, and fun rustic bunkbeds for young visitors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-wedding-georgie-mansion-ss-backgrid-post5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>A “Summer Cottage” with a tin roof and original brickwork fireplace is ideal for hosting summer barbecues, per Homes & Gardens. Its outdoor deck, stone tiled floors, and exposed beam ceiling also make it a uniquely inviting space for guests.</p><h2>Outside Ben’s Georgia Home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ben-Affleck-Georgia-Home-JLo-Wedding-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The nautical theme throughout extends to the home’s riverfront dock, where a replica of author <strong>Ernest Hemingway</strong>‘s fishing boat, Pilar, reportedly rests. That’s no surprise, given that the rustic bunk beds in the Oyster House were made from the salvaged timber of out-of-commission sailing ships. The romantic dock is connected to a long bridge, which leads visitors back to the expansive deck off the Summer Cottage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-wedding-georgia-house-backgrid-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>It’s hard to imagine, but the Shakespeare in Love actor once tried to offload the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breathtaking property</a> that will now host his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding celebration</a>. Ben listed the home and attempted to sell it for about $8 million back in 2019. He later pulled it off the market, and it’s a good thing. Having seen the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>incredible photos</a> of the property’s cozy library, bright white bathrooms, equestrian facilities, circular driveway, and dining area fit for royalty, it’s hard to imagine Bennifer 2.0 celebrating anywhere else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-wedding-georgia-house-backgrid-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Before the big Georgia wedding bash, the superstar couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made it official</a> by registering for a marriage license in Clark County, NV on Saturday, July 16. According to the license filing obtained by <strong>Hollywoodlife</strong> (below), Jennifer is taking Ben’s last name, as she is listed as “Jennifer Affleck.” At the time, the “Waiting For Tonight” hitmaker dished on all the details on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>On the JLo</a> newsletter, adding, “We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient.”</p><h2>The Wedding</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Ben’s home transformed into a gorgeous wedding venue at the helm of event planner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Colin Cowie</strong></a>, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>oversaw the three-day affair</a> that reportedly cost $400K. Trucks could be seen entering the property days ahead of their Aug. 20 wedding, with catering and party equipment, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>several white tents</a>. A dining area was also seen set-up at the end of the dock area, presumably for either the smaller rehearsal dinner or the wedding reception.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The wedding events kicked off with an Aug. 19 rehearsal dinner, followed by the ceremony and reception on Aug. 20. The couple could be seen walking down a long white aisle after the ceremony, officiated by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jay Shetty</strong></a>, as their kids <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>walked behind them</a>. Jennifer’s child <strong>Emme</strong>, 14, and Ben’s daughter <strong>Seraphina</strong>, 13, assisted the Bronx native with her 20 foot long veil, while <strong>Violet</strong>, 16, <strong>Max</strong>, 14, and <strong>Samuel</strong>, 10, were also seen in the images.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Other inside photos, obtained by the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>, showed Ben’s love of film with&nbsp;Casablanca&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gone With The Wind&nbsp;posters, that also appeared to be part of the wedding decor. Rustic wooden chairs and tables could be seen surrounding a gorgeous off-white four layered cake, alongside a wooden sign reading “baby, i love u,” in reference to her 2003 song.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GepWaZlpu5pq%2FKZp6ep6KctqJ5x6iknmVkbX55hZdpZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerry-lawson-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Lawson Death Cause, How Did Jerry Lawson Pass Away?</span></a>
