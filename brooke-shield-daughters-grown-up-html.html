Her daughters, Rowan Francis and Grier Hammond Henchy, always loved her curves and assured her she had nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, they encouraged her to show her body off because it is amazing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The&nbsp;Suddenly Susan alum has more things to show off and be proud of—the milestones of her daughters. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Mama’s Precious Angels</h2><p>Shield tied the knot with&nbsp;tennis player Andre Agassi in 1997, but their marriage fell apart in 1999. Following the divorce, she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acquainted</a> with television writer Chris Henchy through mutual friends.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The two then hit it off and got&nbsp;married two years later in 2001. It is this marriage that has blessed the couple, and the world, with two exceptionally talented young ladies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Their daughters Rowan Francis and the&nbsp;Grier Hammond&nbsp;turned 17 and 15 respectively this year. They seem to be following in their mother's footsteps by pursuing their artistic interests.&nbsp;</p><p>Shields, on the other hand, encourages their passions but prioritizes their education&nbsp;more. She commented that if the art bug still sticks around after college, they are free to chase it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rowan Blooming into a Promising Leading Lady</h2><p>On June 5,&nbsp;Shields posted a series of adorable pictures of her and her elder daughter Rowan. The occasion was the 17-year-old’s prom, she donned&nbsp;her mother’s gown. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It wasn't just another&nbsp;gown — Shield wore it&nbsp;when she was nominated for the Golden Globes in 1998.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The Lipstick Jungle actress captioned that nothing in the world could have prepared to see her child in the special dress. That moment made her exceptionally proud to mark Rowan’s coming-of-age.</p><p>Soon after, the daughter would make her even prouder by graduating. On Jun 9, 2021, Rowan graduated high school with flying coolers and stumped everyone by performing Ed Sheeran’s ‘Pictures’ with a guitar and an angelic voice.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To commemorate her achievement, they got matching ladybug <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tattoos</a>. The proud mom got it on her wrist while the achieving daughter got it on her ankle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Grier’s Uncanny Resemblance to Shields</h2><p>The younger daughter is still in her teens, but the world has seen her in every stage of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">life</a>. And from what we have seen so far, Grier is a splitting image of her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>From piercing blue eyes to the swooping almond shapes, high set cheekbones, and tall posture, the two can be mistaken for twins.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The 80s supermodel had shared that Grier regularly receives offers from all left, right, and center to pursue a career in modeling. The young lady, however, seems to like to keep things <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">low-key</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Shield supports Grier's choice&nbsp;and emphasizes she should have as much of a conventional childhood as she can. Shields also spoke from experience that college comes first for Grier as the modeling world can be demanding and distracting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Shield says her daughter&nbsp;has a well-adjusted boldness and assertiveness about her, which is why she is confident Grier&nbsp;will do just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2FsLvKnmSsoJmauaV5w5qsoKCkmr%2B0ecarprCmXaq9b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mr-mercedes-what-to-expect-season-2.html><span>←</span><span>'Mr. Mercedes': Everything we know so far and what to expect from season 2</span></a>
