She first crossed her arms and leaned over a railing before turning around and gazing into the distance. In the last snap, she sat on stairs in Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field stadium, posing in blue cuffed jeans and sneakers.</p><p>Kylie styled the jacket with a black T-shirt and dainty stud earrings. She donned soft glam, including filled-in eyebrows, rosy cheeks and mascara. Her dirty blonde locks were parted down the middle and worn in soft curls.</p><p>“We know you’ve been waiting for this one 😉,” the Eagles’ account captioned the photos. “The iconic ’90s Eagles Letterman Jacket drops TOMORROW at @eaglesproshop locations. Plus, bid on @kykelce’s autographed jacket to support @eaglesautism!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kylie-Kelce-Beams-in-Replica-of-Princess-Diana-Iconic-Philadelphia-Eagles-Jacket.jpg><p>The famous jacket was first worn by Diana in 1991 when she was taking <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> to school. She reportedly got the jacket from Jack Edelstein, the Eagles’ former statistician. Edelstein, who was family friends with Princess Grace of Monaco, met Diana — <a href=#>who died in August 1997 at age 36</a> — at Grace’s funeral in 1982.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kylie-Kelce-Channels-Princess-Diana-in-Vintage-Philadelphia-Eagles-Letterman-Jacket2.jpg><p>In an October interview with <a href=#>ESPN</a>, <strong>Marnie Schneider</strong>, who is the granddaughter of former Eagles owner Leonard Tose, explained, “While having a conversation with Princess Diana, [Edelstein] discovered that she knew nothing about American football but that she did love the colors green and silver.”</p><p>Edelstein then returned to Philadelphia and told Tose — who died in 2003 at age 88 — about Diana’s love for the colors, and the duo had a jacket designed and sent to her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She <a href=#>sported the jacket again</a> in 1994 in photos that appeared on the cover of People magazine. It is currently unknown where Diana’s jacket original is or whether it still exists.</p><p>The reimagined jacket will go on sale Thursday, November 9, and reportedly retails for $400.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6DGrbXEZqKepJOaerG70p6qZqGeYr%2BmvMuimppln5t6sb7Ip5qeq6NisaqtzZqqZp2RnLmmv4yjmJyjlal8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-rory-mcilory-made-his-150-million-fortune.html><span>←</span><span>How Rory McIlory Made His $150 Million Fortune</span></a>
