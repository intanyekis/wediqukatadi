[praying-hand emoji] Definitely down to talk more, because the public needs to see two talented, successful, imperfect black men have tough conversations.”</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I love you too much to not be honest with you, and right now, you’re deflecting,” he said in the video, before claiming more people listen to the mogul’s music than benefit from his charity. A little later, he went through all the ways in which he too has given back to the community, from aiding scholarships to lecturing at universities.</p><p>Check out the full video below:</p><p></p><p>The online spat started when Dee-1 stopped by <a href=# rel=noopener>Sway in the Morning</a> last month, where he called on <a href=#>Meek Mill</a>, <a href=#>Jim Jones</a> and Rick Ross to consider the impact of their lyrical content.</p><p>“Jim Jones, you could do better, brother,” he said. “I love you too much to not be honest with you. Rick Ross, you could do better, brother. Meek Mill, you could do better, brother! I love you too much not to be honest with you. Oh, you <a href=# rel=noopener>the face of prison reform</a>?

[…] Don’t question Bawse. You heard me, lil’ man? Get that basket off your head, so you could think clear, lil’ man. […] Since you wanna go viral, I’m gonna show you how to go viral, lil’ man.”</p><p>He continued: “Go viral feedin’ them kids in your hood. Go viral givin’ them bikes away. Go viral Christmas time! Don’t be sayin’, ‘Jim Jones.’ Jim Jones just gave away goddamn six figures worth of clothes in his hood. And you a n-gga who talkin’. Lookin’ vegan, knowin’ you eatin’ more goddamn biggly-wiggly bacon than any other n-gga out here.

Y’all forgot that fast.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibnp1dZnqztcKkZKuno6h6t7XRmqNmq6CWwW6vzqeroqalmsA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-most-expensive-celebrity-chefs-kitchens-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Expensive Celebrity Chef Kitchens Of All Time, Ranked</span></a>
