Only Ken Anderson (32,838) sits ahead of Dalton on the franchise leaderboard in passing yards (31,594).</p><p>Dalton was one of the primary trade candidates entering the offseason, but nothing ever materialized. The&nbsp;32-year-old now joins fellow Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton in free agency.</p><p>With the draft now over, both Dalton and Newton should find work in short time. The Jacksonville Jaguars and New England Patriots look like the best landing spots, since neither of them have a truly established starting quarterback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady Visits Wrong Home In Tampa Bay, Breaks Florida's Stay-At-Home Orders</a></strong></p><p>The Bengals made the playoffs in each of Dalton's first five seasons, winning the AFC North in the 2013 and 2015 seasons. However, Cincinnati was unable to win a single regular season game despite the consistency in the regular season.</p><p>Injuries to key players, poor drafting and a lack of activity in free agency quickly led to a downfall of the Bengals, who have recorded losing seasons in each of the last four years. The Baltimore Ravens have emerged as the top team in the AFC North thanks to Lamar Jackson, the reigning league MVP.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The future is looking bright for the Bengals with Burrow leading the way. As good as Dalton was for most of his tenure in Cincinnati, it was simply time for a change with the organization continually taking steps backward. Dalton leaves behind a fine legacy in Cincinnati, and a fresh start was always going to be best for both sides.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Quarterbacks Have Signed Contracts Worth $900 Million In Past Year</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tompWjtKK40mapnqSVlsCmedCumKuslaevoq%2FKZpinnKlisaK406ilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-nicole-smith-autopsy.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Nicole Smith Autopsy Revealed Her Exact Cause Of Death</span></a>
