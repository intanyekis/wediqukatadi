This forced <strong>Spelling and McDermott to</strong><strong>move quite a few times</strong> over the past few years. Several <a href=#>lawsuits affected Spelling's net worth</a>, and she and her husband faced ups and downs in their acting careers. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cancelation of the sitcom Mystery Girls</a> that Spelling starred in alongside Jennie Garth back in 2014 was just one blow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the summer of 2023, Entertainment Tonight reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spelling began staying in an RV</a> with her five kids because their house had mold. A source explained that this is what worked for the star's budget. According to Page Six, they also spent some time at a motel. This must have been tough for the whole family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tori-spelling-marriage-to-dean-mcdermott.jpg><p>The couple's relationship took many twists and turns, which must have been tough for Spelling's children to deal with. In 2018, Life & Style Magazine reported that worry about money made Spelling and McDermott's family life tough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Problems In Dean McDermott And Tori Spelling's Marriage</p></th><th scope=col><p>Date (According to Us Weekly)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Us Weekly reported McDermott had an affair with Emily Goodman when he filmed Chopped Canada</p></td><td><p>December 2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>the couple hadn't paid credit card bills totaling $39,000</p></td><td><p>2016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>police came to the couple's house because of an argument</p></td><td><p>2018</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>a source told Us Weekly their marriage had been in a rough spot since 2020</p></td><td><p>2021</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>McDermott said they were going to divorce, then deleted his social media message</p></td><td><p>June 2023</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>McDermott was photographed alongside his girlfriend Lily Cato</p></td><td><p>October 2023</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>McDermott was interviewed by The Daily Mail and talked about divorcing Spelling</p></td><td><p>November 2023</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A source said:</p><p>"She loves him and has always tried to keep the relationship together, but she’s at the end of her rope... are at each other’s throats over so many issues — everything from their dire financial situation to neither of them having a steady job to not being able to adequately support their five children."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/andy-cohen-insulted-tori-spelling-multiple-times-including-when-he-said-she-could-never-be-a-real-housewife-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Andy Cohen Insulted Tori Spelling Multiple Times, Including When He Said She Could Never Be A Real Housewife">Andy Cohen Insulted Tori Spelling Multiple Times, Including When He Said She Could Never Be A Real Housewife</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tori Spelling wasn't thrilled when Andy Cohen made a few negative comments about her.</p><p>According to Life & Style, the couple didn't have enough funds to get divorced. Since it sounds like they wanted to get divorced before they actually separated, it's possible that their kids heard them arguing and noticed that something was wrong. This is heartbreaking to think about, although of course many couples unfortunately find themselves in this situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-1.jpg><p>It sounds like the couple's relationship problems might have affected where the kids slept. In 2021, according to CNN, <strong>Spelling said her kids slept in the same room as her </strong>on a SiriusXM Jeff Lewis Live interview. She said that this started when McDermott was traveling for a project. If the couple didn't experience so many problems, they might have slept in the same bed and encouraged their children to sleep in their own rooms.</p><p>Spelling said:</p><p>“Since he left – this is not good, you guys – but since he left, he was gone for six months filming in another country, they all stayed with me. So, I currently still have four in the bedroom with me who have yet to go back to their rooms.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tori Spelling's children were also affected by her difficult relationship with Dean McDermott because, as he told The Daily Mail in 2015, <strong>McDermott's drinking scared the children</strong>. Us Weekly also reported in December 2023 that McDermott hadn't spent solo time with the children in a while because they were working through their problems.</p><h2 id=inside-tori-spelling-39-s-attorney-visits>Inside Tori Spelling's Attorney Visits</h2><p>For several years, there were rumors about Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott getting divorced, and there were often news stories about Spelling at her attorney's office. It's possible that Spelling paid an attorney for several years and talked to them about her options. According to several news articles, <strong>Spelling</strong><strong>considered divorce for a long time.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tori-spelling-has-denied-getting-work-done-on-her-face-but-according-to-plastic-surgeons-she-s-lying-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, Page Six reported that she was photographed standing outside of her attorney's office and speaking on her cell phone. She seemed upset and had a pad of paper that said words associated with divorce, including "assets" and "custody." Hollywood Life also reported that the star wasn't wearing her wedding ring, which might have suggested trouble.</p><p>A source told Page Six in 2021 that friends of Spelling's thought it made sense that she might divorce McDermott. According to this source, she didn't see her friends much anymore.</p><h2 id=is-tori-spelling-still-married>Is Tori Spelling Still Married?</h2><p>Since <strong>Tori Spelling filed for divorce in March 2024</strong>, according to Today.com, <strong>Spelling and Dean McDermott are still married </strong>at the time of this writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear how long the divorce proceedings will take, and since they will be working out custody of their kids, that might take a while. According to People, Spelling wants joint legacy and sole physical custody of their five children. Depending on the agreement, their divorce will definitely affect their five kids since they might see Spelling more often than McDermott.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_tori-spelling-revealed-the-reason-she-stayed-with-dean-mcdermott-for-18-years-despite-wanting-a-divorce_bk_a1.jpg><p>Who Did Tori Spelling Date?
