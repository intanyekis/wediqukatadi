She was born on 28th August 2005 in McIntyre, Georgia, and gained fame as a child beauty contestant and the star of the reality show “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” (2012 – 2014). Alana’s parents are Mike Thompson and June Shannon, who married in 2013. She also has three half sisters: Jessica, Lauryn, and Anna.</p><p>Alana’s rise to fame began with her participation in the reality television series “Toddlers & Tiaras” (2009 – 2013) on TLC, which focused on children in beauty pageants. This led to spin-off series including “Eden’s World” (2012), “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” (2012 – 2014), and “Cheer Perfection” (2012). Despite attracting over two million viewers per episode, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” received mixed reactions due to its controversial content.</p><p>The cancellation of “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” was linked to June Shannon’s relationship with a convicted child molester, leading to further scrutiny of the family’s private life. However, the family also received positive attention for addressing issues such as Alana’s weight on the syndicated talk show “The Doctors” in 2015, which resulted in her losing approximately 20 pounds.</p><p>Alana’s net worth primarily stems from her television appearances, reportedly earning $50,000 per episode of “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” and various endorsement deals. Despite the controversies surrounding her family and their TV show, Alana continues to be in the public eye, and her net worth reflects her success in the entertainment industry.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmifqKaVrnqju85mmainXZi1qrjDZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./antonio-juliano-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Antonio Juliano Obituary: The entire club is saddened when former napoli midfielder antonio juliano</span></a>
