During Malik’s time on the reality series in 2010, he met and briefly dated fellow contestant <strong>Geneva Lane</strong>. The “Pillowtalk” singer went on to date <strong>Rebecca Ferguson</strong> — another <a href=#>X Factor alum</a> — for four months in 2011. Ferguson later called the romance her “first mistake” during a November 2013 interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Independent</a>.</p><p>“I was 23, he was 18. Of course, if it was a 23-year-old guy dating an 18-year-old girl, no one would have batted an eyelid, <a href=#>but this way around was a big deal</a>, apparently,” she told the outlet. “I didn’t realize that. I was just a hippy, free-loving person, but that’s not a good thing to be in this industry. You can’t just follow your heart.”</p><p>The same year he split from Ferguson, Malik started dating Edwards. The pair met in December 2011 <a href=#>when One Direction returned</a> to perform on the show that launched their success, where Edwards was competing as part of girl group Little Mix at the time. The <a href=#>musicians got engaged in August 2013</a> before <a href=#>calling it quits two years later</a>. The “Shout Out to My Ex” songstress claimed that Malik broke up with her via text message.</p><p>“It was horrible, the worst time in my life,” she wrote in a passage from Little Mix’s book, Our World, which was released in October 2016. “A four-year relationship, <a href=#>two-year engagement ended by a simple text message</a>. Just like that. Even though things in my career were going really well, it was incredibly difficult for me.”</p><p>Malik, for his part, denied that he dumped Edwards via text during a November 2015 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Fader </a>magazine.</p><p>“I have more respect for Perrie than to end anything over text message,” he told the publication at the time. “I love her a lot, and I always will, and I would never <a href=#>end our relationship [of] over four years like that.”</a></p><p>The Mind of Mine artist moved on with Hadid in late 2015. After packing on the PDA in the January 2016 “Pillowtalk” music video, the duo <a href=#>made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala</a> that May. They split the following month before reconciling just five days later.</p><p>Malik and the Next in Fashion cohost continued to break up and make up several times <a href=#>over the course of their romance</a>, calling it quits for good in October 2021. In September 2020 — during one of their “on again” periods — the twosome welcomed <a href=#>their daughter, Khai</a>.</p><p>“To try put into words how i am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The <a href=#>love I feel for this tiny human is beyond</a> my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, & thankful for the life we will have together x,” Malik wrote via Twitter at the time.</p><p>Although <a href=#>things didn’t work out</a> between the former boy band member and Hadid, the <a href=#>exes have maintained an amicable relationship</a> for the sake of their daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You have a long life alongside this person,” Hadid told London’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Sunday Times </a>in March 2023 of coparenting. “That [Khai] <a href=#>can be with both parents</a> makes me very happy.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at Malik’s dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkx6LFzWakmqSZoMBusMCtoKefXZ22tMDOq7BmqJWnv6qxjJ6bsJmimcBus8igoGagkZm2pXnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scarlett-leithold-bf-age-height-body-net-worth-insta.html><span>←</span><span>Scarlett Leithold: Boyfriend, Body, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
