I do, I get everybody something but it’s like, most of the time it keeps me out of trouble. I take my daughter out for Valentine’s Day and my son doesn’t get to go.”</p><p>Berman, 54, argued that Valentine’s Day is meant to celebrate all kinds of love, not just the romantic kind. “Why does it have to be a heterosexual thing?” she asked before noting that Cannon is not “romantically involved” with any of his kids.</p><p>Berman wrapped up the topic by suggesting the father of 12 get his sons a “big stuffed animal” as a way to show his love for them. “Yeah,” he replied, “but I’m not sending them roses.”</p><p>As he mentioned during the episode, Cannon took his eldest daughter Monroe, 12, out to dinner to celebrate Valentine’s Day on Wednesday, February 14. “Best Valentines Date Ever!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️,” he captioned <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> pics of their night out at the Suga Factory in New York City one day later. (Cannon welcomed Monroe and her twin brother, Moroccan, with ex-wife <strong>Mariah Carey</strong> in 2011.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nick-Cannon-Shares-Why-He-Doesn-t-Buy-His-Sons-Valentine-s-Day-Presents.jpg><p>Cannon also shares sons Golden, 6, and Rise, 15 months, and daughter Powerful, 3, with <strong>Brittany Bell</strong>, twins Zion and Zillion, 2, and daughter Beautiful, 3 months, with <strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong>, son Legendary, 7 months, with <strong>Bre Tiesi</strong>, and daughter Onyx, 5 months, with <strong>LaNisha Cole</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> host shares daughter Halo, 14 months, with <strong>Alyssa Scott</strong>, as well as his late son Zen, who <a href=#>died at five months old</a> in December 2021 after a battle with brain cancer.</p><p>“Being a father of multiple kids, it’s always the biggest guilt on me is that I don’t get to spend enough time with all my children,” Cannon confessed during a December 2022 episode of <a href=#>The Checkup With Dr. David Agus</a>. “One, ’cause I’m constantly working, and two, because I’m just spread thin.”</p><p>Cannon, however, did manage to spend quality time with <a href=#>seven of his kids in one day</a> last month, and he took fans inside her busy day via his Instagram Story. “Had a daddy daughter date with The Powerful Queen!!!” he captioned a pic of himself with Powerful before going on to visit Rise, Legendary, Zion and Zillion, Onyx and Halo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2Wjna6zsdJmrqGxXZ2ybrDOnqqnrF2Xwrp5x6KqZqufo8BuwsClnKesmaOytHnDmrBmqKKawKa606xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-steve-martin-martin-short-call-jimmy-fallon-out-for-being-fake-with-interview-guests.html><span>←</span><span>Did Steve Martin And Martin Short Call Jimmy Fallon Out For Being Fake With Interview Guests?</span></a>
