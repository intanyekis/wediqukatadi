Keep reading for everything we know about Sergeant Voight’s fate and whether or not <a href=# rel=noopener>Jason Beghe is leaving</a> Chicago P.D.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Jason Beghe leaving Chicago P.D.?</h2><p>The answer is no. Jason Beghe’s character, Sergeant Hank Voight, found himself in mortal danger in the Season 11 finale, but he managed to make it out of the ordeal alive with a little help from Detective Hailey Upton (Tracy Spiridakos). In the penultimate episode, Upton finally broke open the case they had been investigating for weeks and learned that the serial killer is a man named Frank Matson (Dennis Flanagan), who works with the police department as their station’s lock up time keeper. While she and the rest of the squad were searching for Matson, the killer was drugging Voight’s drink and abducting him.</p><p>The season closer was a nail-biter, as the squad had to race to find Voight in time and save him. Meanwhile, Voight was tied up in a basement and being tortured by Matson, who was trying to get him to call the person he loves the most — Upton — so that he could kill them both. Not wanting to risk Upton’s safety, Voight refused to call her and continued to suffer through Matson’s torture. At one point, while he was nearly bleeding out from stab wounds, Voight hallucinated and saw <a href=# rel=noopener>Alvin Olinsky</a> (Elias Koteas). While talking to the late detective, who was killed in Season 5, Voight accepted his looming death, but Olinsky encouraged him to keep fighting. Upton eventually found him and the pair managed to escape together, but she ultimately decided to <a href=# rel=noopener>step back from the CPD</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> The Chicago P.D.

Underneath <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">a promo</a> for the episode, one fan guessed that Voight would refuse to call anyone for help. “The only person I think he’d call is Hailey and I don’t think shed fall for it. But also Voight is really smart he would NEVER put anyone he cares for in danger,” they wrote. Another fan agreed that Voight wouldn’t die, noting: “Voight is immortal he always makes it out.” Although fans seemed confident in Voight’s survival, several worried that Upton was going to get killed off since it was <a href=# rel=noopener>Spiridakos’ last-ever episode</a>. “When he said Voight got one phone call to make, I feel like Upton is gonna get killed. OH NO!!!!” one viewer wrote. A second added: “This might not end good for Upton, as I can see the serial killer killing her.”</p><p>Beghe had hinted early on in the season that Upton wouldn’t be killed off, however, telling <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a>: “I assume that she’s going to leave on good terms. I don’t think she’s going to die or anything like that. I hope not. I certainly have hope that she’ll be back.” The final scene showed Upton researching jobs at the FBI, FEMA and DEA, so if she’s not leaving law enforcement entirely, it’s possible that she might return for future cameos.</p><p>Although fans are sad about losing Upton, they can rest assured knowing that Beghe isn’t going where anytime soon. In fact, the original cast member told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in March 2024 that he wants to stay on the show for as long as NBC will have him. “I’ll always be a part of&nbsp;Chicago P.D. That, I know,” he told the outlet. “I certainly have the interest. And I think that NBC has the interest in both the show and Voight. So, I’m not done, I have more to do, and I’m anxious to do it. I love my job. I don’t know what the end is, whether it’s Thursday or Friday, but I supposed it’ll end at some point. But right now, I feel like I have stories to tell and a job to do.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> Chicago P.D.’s Best and Worst Characters, Ranked</a></p><p>Chicago P.D. is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Chicago P.D., <a href=# rel=noopener>check out what these former cast members are doing now</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2d%2BcX2Oo5isp55ir6azx55kpZ2Rq7avs4ycn6KbkZy8brzDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-graham.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Graham Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Facts, Biography</span></a>
