Many factors affect someone’s ability to save, and many people want to save more than they actually are.</p><p>During the initial days of the pandemic, many saw their savings account balances rise. But today is different. Americans’ expenses are increasing faster than their paychecks, and savings have fallen.</p><p>The median bank account balance is $5,300, according to the latest Federal Reserve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">survey data</a>. Consumers’ personal savings rate — the percentage of disposable income put towards savings — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was 3.5% in July</a>, down from almost 10% two years ago.</p><p>Comparing your savings to others can inspire you to set financial goals and adopt better savings habits. But everyone’s situation is different, so it’s important to use these benchmarks as a tool for learning rather than a measure of self-worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does the average person have in savings?</h2><p>The median account balance in 2019 was around $5,300, while the average account balance is around $41,600. This is the latest available data, as the Federal Reserve releases this survey every three years. The Fed plans to publish its 2022 survey data later this year.</p><p>Remember that outliers with high account balances can skew the average, making it less representative of the typical savings of most households.</p><p>Income level, expenses, financial goals, and debt can affect your savings. Savings can also fluctuate yearly — and a lot has happened since 2019.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Average savings by age&nbsp;</h3><p>Age often corresponds with savings balance. The younger you are, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less time you have to build up your savings</a>.</p><p>As you get older and potentially earn a higher income, you have more disposable income to put towards savings. The power of compounding interest over time can also benefit those who have been saving for a long time.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table class=has-fixed-layout><tr><th>Age</th><th><strong>Median bank account balance</strong></th></tr><tbody><tr><td>&lt;35</td><td>$3,240</td></tr><tr><td>35-44</td><td>$4,710</td></tr><tr><td>45-54</td><td>$6,400</td></tr><tr><td>55-64</td><td>$5,620</td></tr><tr><td>65-74</td><td>$8,000</td></tr><tr><td>>74</td><td>$9,300</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Average savings by income&nbsp;</h3><p>Income also determines how much money you can set aside for the future. When you have more disposable income, you generally have more room to save.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a lower income, saving can be more challenging, as you may use more of your income for immediate expenses. This can result in lower savings rates and a reduced ability to accumulate wealth.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table class=has-fixed-layout><tr><th>Income</th><th><strong>Median bank account balance</strong></th></tr><tbody><tr><td>&lt;$20,000</td><td>$810</td></tr><tr><td>$20,000-$39,999</td><td>$2,050</td></tr><tr><td>$40,000-$59,999</td><td>$4,320</td></tr><tr><td>$60,000-$79,999</td><td>$10,000</td></tr><tr><td>$80,000-$89,999</td><td>$20,000</td></tr><tr><td>$90,000-$100,000</td><td>$70,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What influences your ability to save?</h2><p>Several factors can impact your ability to build your savings:</p><ul><li><strong>Income: </strong>The amount of money you earn affects your ability to save. Generally, higher income levels can lead to higher savings.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expenses: </strong>If your expenses are high, saving a significant amount may be more challenging.</li><li><strong>Budgeting: </strong>Creating and sticking to a budget can help you prioritize your spending and allocate funds for savings.</li><li><strong>Financial discipline: </strong>Avoiding impulsive purchases and unnecessary expenses can increase your savings.</li><li><strong>Debt:</strong> If you have significant debt, such as loans or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">credit card payments</a>, it can affect your ability to save. Prioritizing debt repayment may limit your savings in the short term but can benefit your finances in the long run.</li></ul><p>There are also some factors that are completely out of your control. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Studies show</a> certain racial and ethnic groups face systemic barriers that can lead to lower wages and limited wealth-building opportunities. Education level also plays a role in savings rates, as higher education often leads to better job prospects and higher incomes.</p><p>It’s important to note these are general trends, and individual factors also play a significant role in savings rates.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why it feels harder to save right now</h3><p>Economic factors, such as inflation rates, interest rates, and job stability, also impact your ability to save. Unstable or uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult to put money aside for savings.</p><p>Today, living costs are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rising faster</a> than most people’s paychecks. A recent report found the average American’s expenses increased 9% in 2022, outpacing inflation, which was 8% during that time.</p><p>Higher expenses mean limited funds for savings or meeting other financial goals. It also explains why <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">credit card balances are growing</a> as Americans take on debt to cover their purchases.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much should you really have in savings?&nbsp;</h2><p>Most experts recommend saving enough to cover three to six months of living expenses. Emergency savings can protect against unexpected events like job loss or a medical emergency.</p><p>Beyond the emergency fund, there are no fixed rules for how much to save. This will depend on your financial situation and goals. To understand how well you’re doing with your savings, ask yourself these questions.</p><li><strong>Do I have a dedicated savings account? </strong>This means an account specifically for storing, not spending, money. If you don’t, it’s time to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">open one</a>.</li><li><strong>What percentage of your income are you saving each month? </strong>Most experts recommend putting aside between 10%-15% percent of your earnings.</li><li><strong>Could I cover at least three months of expenses if I lost my job? </strong>If yes, you’re better off than half of Americans. According to a Bankrate report, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">22% of people have no emergency savings</a>, and nearly 30% have some but not enough to cover three months’ worth of expenses.&nbsp;</li><p>It’s important to remember that your savings target may change based on your goals and the larger economy.</p><p>“A raw dollar amount isn’t as important as thinking about how long that amount will last,” says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “Over time, expenses tend to increase, and inflation devalues your savings. So, you need to consistently reassess how many months of expenses you can cover in the event of a job loss.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tips to boost your savings</h2><p>If you’re worried about the current status of your savings, now’s the time to focus on your finances. Consider these tips to save more:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Create a budget: </strong>Start by tracking your income and expenses to understand where your money is going. This will help you identify areas where you can cut back and save more.</li><li><strong>Set savings goals: </strong>Establish specific savings goals, such as saving for a down payment, emergency fund, or retirement. Having clear targets will keep you motivated and focused on saving.</li><li><strong>Set it and forget it:</strong> Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to a dedicated savings account. This way, you can save a portion of your income before you have a chance to spend it.</li><li><strong>Reduce unnecessary expenses: </strong>Evaluate your spending habits and identify areas where you can make cuts. Consider reducing discretionary expenses like eating out, entertainment, or subscription services.</li><li><strong>Look for ways to increase your income: </strong>Explore opportunities to boost your earning potential, such as taking on a side gig or freelance work. The additional income can be directed towards savings.</li><li><strong>Minimize debt:</strong> Prioritize paying off high-interest debt, such as credit cards or personal loans. By reducing interest payments, you’ll have more funds available to save.</li><li><strong>Cut back on impulse buying: </strong>Give yourself a cooling-off period before making a purchase. This will help you determine whether it’s a necessary expense or an impulse buy.</li><li><strong>Review your progress: </strong>Regularly assess your savings strategy and adjust as needed. As your financial situation changes, adapt your savings goals and habits accordingly. “Once a quarter, it’s smart to take time to see where you stand,” McBride says. “If you had a big unplanned expense that puts a dent in your emergency savings, you may need to focus on allocating more money to boost that fund.”</li></ul><p>Where you store your savings matters, too. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best savings accounts</a> come with competitive interest rates that help you earn more money over time and slow the impact of inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, building savings takes time and discipline. Start small and gradually increase your savings rate. You can make significant progress toward your financial goals with persistence and commitment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The bottom line</h2><p>Instead of worrying about how your savings stack up to the average, focus on your own specific savings goals.</p><p>Make a priority list to keep yourself on track. The first step needs to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your emergency fund</a>. Once you have an emergency savings cushion, consider your other goals, like saving to buy a house or retiring comfortably.</p><p>Opinions expressed are author’s alone, not those of any bank, credit card issuer, or other entity.
