In a thrilling conclusion to the show, <a href=#>he blasted “The Tribal Chief” with a superkick</a> and stood tall alongside his brother, Jimmy Uso, who previously betrayed Reigns at WWE Night of Champions.</p><p>During an appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pat McAfee Show</a>, the former SmackDown commentator asked Heyman about the situation and questioned whether it was Heyman’s fault. In response, Heyman claimed that The Usos were going through growing pains. He also stated that he hoped the duo would show their greatness when they take a beating from Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa at WWE Money in the Bank.</p><p>“100% my fault? I don’t know how we could take that position, so I do respect your opinion. Listen, this is growing pains,” Heyman said. “The Usos are now experiencing the same growing pains that they did when they were children and they were always second to Roman Reigns. Whether it be on the football field or at the house, who got the better food, the better nutrition to build the better body or who could just whip who’s ass in the backyard, it was always the Tribal Chief that remained dominant over the twins. I did take two twins to put one Tribal Chief down.</p><p>“I love the twins. I love Jey and Jimmy and I hope that they will display the same greatness that they did as the greatest tag team champions of all time when they take their beatings from Roman Reigns and Solo at Money in the Bank on July 1 in London. I’m very proud of them to be willing to take those beatings.”</p><p>Throughout the downfall of The Bloodline, the argument that Reigns has used The Usos has been a consistent conversation. McAfee brought this view up to Heyman, who explained that anyone at the top had to deal with people criticizing them.</p><p>“Everyone wants to shoot out in the OK Corral,” Heyman said. “When you are the top gunslinger, everyone [else] says ‘Oh, I can shoot a gun faster’ but no one truly can. And when Roman Reigns is the undisputed number one biggest box office attraction of all time — the WrestleMania grosses speak for themselves, the Saudi Arabia events speak for themselves, the grosses in London, in Cardiff, speak for themselves. The ratings on SmackDown — and this is with the loss of Pat McAfee as the color commentator — speak for themselves.</p><p>:So, everyone wants to take their pokes and their criticism of Roman Reigns. Of course, he’s the undisputed number one and when you’re [in that position], everyone says they can do [better],” Heyman explained, “but none of them do. They point their nasty fingers at Roman Reigns but he’s the undisputed Tribal Chief. And until someone can knock him off that throne, we’re just going to have to live with your criticism.”</p><p>Fans will have to tune into the June 23 episode of WWE SmackDown to see the next chapter of The Bloodline story. WrestleZone will have coverage of the show as it airs.</p><p>The full interview is available here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJxaGtsYmK9osHLZp%2BesZ2Wu27Ax55krqufqHqjsdOrmLKZnGK8p3nRqKSapl2nsqqzzaxkoqtdnL%2Bww8innmaokZ67tA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-hilton-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nicky Hilton Net Worth How Much is Hilton Worth?</span></a>
