Thinking of [<a href=# id=auto-tag_bow-wow_3 data-tag=bow-wow>Bow Wow</a>] brings tears to my eyes because I’m so blessed in so many ways and it’s not the material things.<span id=more-52496></span></p><p>I really don’t accept gifts from Bow Wow like that [but] I remember when he was little?he was probably about 13 or 14?he used to get an allowance and he saved up his little money and bought me a Rolex. You should have seen the expression on his face. He was so excited just to be able to give me something because he’s such a giving person. He always wants to shower me with gifts and I’m not about that, I’m about the love. It’s the small things that me feel happy and proud.</p><p><span><strong><span>“I have to check Bow Wow all the time because I raised him to be humble.”</span></strong></span></p><p>Inside of my home there’s no such thing as a celebrity. I have to check Bow Wow all the time because I raised him to be humble. We go at it a lot but I always win. Sometimes I have to check him because he gets down about the things somebody wrote on some website. He came to me like who is this girl [<a href=# id=auto-tag_kat-stacks_3 data-tag=kat-stacks>Kat Stacks</a>] and I was so mad at him for entertaining that. Your faith is supposed to be so strong that what people write about you, you shouldn’t even pay it attention. That’s negativity. I raised him to be a true gentleman and I always tell him to treat women like he wants me to be treated.</p><p>Mother’s should let their loved ones know what they expect especially on mother’s day. If you want breakfast in bed then tell your husband or your kids that that’s wht you want. It’s your day. This year I plan to enjoy tons of flowers, I have a spa day with one of my girlfriends and Bow’s probably going to take me to dinner. It’s just a day of relaxing and no work. I thank God for allowing me to be a mother because there are a lot of people that don’t have that gift. ?As Told To Starrene Rhett</p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=#>Oh, Mama! 7 Hip-Hop Songs To Avoid On Mother’s Day</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6mys7HSmmScmZyZxKa4y2armqSbqHquu9OhnKugn6Sxbq3Dr6CsnaNir7DDjLCmsGWZnLuwvsRmopqsXajBoq%2FKrGRuamRug3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monica-vaswani-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-15771-html.html><span>←</span><span>Monica Vaswani Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
