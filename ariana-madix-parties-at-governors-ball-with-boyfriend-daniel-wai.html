And in no way, shape or form did I go into that thinking anything,” she explained at the time. “I have just been taking things very, very slow and really enjoying myself. And it’s just really lovely to interact with someone who is just so nice and kind and lovely and caring.”</p><p>After the season 10 finale of Pump Rules aired, Madix gushed about the man in her life during an interview on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “I’ll just say that I am very happy and very satisfied,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Madix’s friends, meanwhile, seem to approve of the new pairing, with <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a> writing, “Good job” in the comments section of Wai’s post.

I’m banging a fine-looking man,’” the beauty mogul, 32, <a href=#>said at the time</a> during an episode her “Give Them Lala” podcast. “She’s looking at [everything] like, ‘Look at my life. I’m happy.’ She said [to me], ‘Wow, I don’t have anxiety anymore. This is strange.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmWu6J5zJqborBdpa6zwMieqmaZpGK0sMLEq6WoqqNir6K4y2auoqyYYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGKxorrInqNmr5GefA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-bynes-calls-obamas-ugly-166330.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Bynes Calls Obamas Ugly</span></a>
