With party goers like <b>Diddy, Destiny’s Child</b> and <b>Barry Bonds, Jay</b> attracted plenty of celebrities to the shindig. It looked like a Hollywood night.</p><p>So, why Atlantic City?</p><p><i>“A.C. was just the next step,”</i><b>Jay</b> said before adding, <i>“New York and New Jersey are neighbors, and there’s just a whole development going on out here.”</i></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>So, how do the mayor and governor feel about this? <i>“I spoke with the mayor and governor and everybody was just so happy to have me here,”</i> he added.</p><p><b>Jay</b> hopes to heighten the popularity of Atlantic City, and bring in many tourists.</p><p><i>“It means that Atlantic City is not just a gambling town; it’s a place where you can come club and shop,”</i><b>Jigga</b> said.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><b>Michelle Williams</b>, a guest at the event understands what <b>Jay</b> is talking about when speaking of Atlantic City.</p><p><i>“I heard somebody say Atlantic City is officially sexy, and it is.
