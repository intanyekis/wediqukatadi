It’s truly a blessing. He’s happier than anyone on this day. I’m so happy and thankful.”</p><p>“<a href=#>Dream was Rob’s favorite name</a> because it was always his dream to have a baby,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively at the time. The infant’s middle name matches her mom’s, whose real name is Angela Renée White.</p><p>Just one month after Dream’s birth, the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star and the model <a href=#>called off their engagement</a>. In September 2017, the former couple <a href=#>settled their custody agreement</a>.</p><p>“Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully coparent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,” the new mom’s attorney <strong>Lisa Bloom</strong> told Us in a statement.</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>amicably raising their daughter</a>, “the key is basically communication,” the Real Blac Chyna star told Us&nbsp;in July 2019.&nbsp;“It makes it a little bit easier if you can communicate with your child’s other parent. That’s the best and healthiest way.”</p><p>The Lashed creator, who also <a href=#>welcomed son King</a> with her ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Tyga</strong></a> in 2012, “appreciates” both of her kids’ fathers. “[They] help out because you have to have that time to yourself, just to even go to the spa and kind of reset,” the beauty salon owner explained. “The days that they’re with their dads, then I go take my trips. Basically, I’m always home with [my kids].”</p><p>As for the Arthur George sock designer, <a href=#>he is a “hands-on dad”</a> to their daughter, a source told Us exclusively in July 2019. “Dream gives Rob direction.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Three years later, <a href=#>Rob gave an update on his coparenting relationship</a> with his ex. “My love for [my 5-year-old daughter],&nbsp;<a href=#>Dream</a>, far outweighs my desire to proceed with my claims against her mother in a public trial,” he said in a February 2022 statement. “Now that the court has ruled that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial on my claim for assault, for our daughter’s sake, I am dismissing the action and focusing on my coparenting relationship with Chyna.”</p><p>From fun <a href=#>Halloween costumes</a> to <a href=#>sweet shots with her cousins</a>, keep scrolling for adorable photos of Dream over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksbOxwKZkpJmima60tMiapWaomZjAbrvFZqmoml2grrOwwKyfopmeYq%2BtrcJmmqGxnpbAbrDArp6hrJWneriAk3Jwa3Ff</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sweeney-todd-broadway-cast.html><span>←</span><span>Sweeney Todd Broadway Cast Earnings and Salary</span></a>
