Since her debut, she has starred in quite a few television series and movies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carol portrayed the character of the evil headmistress, Madame Morrible in the 2005 musical&nbsp;Wicked, which went on&nbsp;until&nbsp;2009.</p><p>Her acting portfolio also includes her performance in theatres, including&nbsp;Love, Loss&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;The Children's Hour&nbsp;(2011), and&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvey&nbsp;(2012).

Her grandparents were Russian immigrants.</p><p><span>Carol Kane's parents separated when she was 12, and the divorce between her parents left her with a sour taste.&nbsp;Being raised by a single mom, she had a void in her life in the absence of her father.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Is Carol Kane Married?</h2><p>Simka Gravas, the on-screen persona embodied by Carol Kane in her acclaimed series Taxi, resembles Carol in some ways.</p><p>Simka is an immigrant; Carol was born into a family of immigrants.</p><p>This is where Carol differs from Simka, though:&nbsp;Simka is an abrasive married woman, who is in constant upheaval with her husband Latka Gravas(Andy Kaufman), whereas&nbsp;Carol is a soft-spoken lady who has never married. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite not marrying she did experience a romantic relationship&nbsp;when she was&nbsp;dating actor Woody Harrelson in the mid-1980s.</p><p>In an interview in 1988, Woody confirmed that they had indeed dated. He described his relationship with Carol as a friendship that turned romantic which returned&nbsp;to being just friends.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, Kane's relationship with Woody was the only time that the actress had an affair in the public eye. However, Woody went on to get married two times since he broke up with Kane. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p>Carol Kane and ex-boyfriend&nbsp;Woody in 1980s.
