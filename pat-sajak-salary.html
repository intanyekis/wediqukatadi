That’s me selfishly screaming for you to stay! Of course you deserve an amazing retirement. Thank you for being a national treasure, sir!” one person wrote. Another Twitter user added: “Big part of my childhood with my family. Thanks for the many laughs and entertainment.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wheel of Fortune</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;officially named a replacement for Sajak on June 27, 2023.&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ryan Seacrest will take over hosting duties</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;from Sajak starting in Season 42, which is expected to premiere in the fall of 2024. “I’m truly humbled to be stepping into the footsteps of the legendary Pat Sajak.

Initially, there was confusion about&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>whether White will leave after Sajak’s retirement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Some reports even suggested that Sony executives were thinking of “eliminating” White’s role altogether if the show got a well-known host who didn’t need the extra publicity. These conversations allegedly occurred during contract negotiations for White to move past the 2023-24 season.</span></p><p>Sajak officially left Wheel of Fortune in his final episode on June 7, 2024. “Well, the time has come to say goodbye,” he said in the episode. “I have a few thanks and acknowledgments before I go, and I want to start with all of you watching out there. It’s been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes night after night, year after year, decade after decade.”</p><p>He continued, “And I’ve always felt like the privilege came with the responsibility to keep this daily half hour a safe place for family fun. No social issues, no politics, nothing embarrassing I hope, just a game. But gradually it became more than that. A place where kids learned their letters, where people from other countries honed their English skills, where families came together along with friends and neighbors, and entire generations.”</p><p>He concluded his speech, “What an honor to play even a small part in all of that. Thank you for allowing me into your lives.”</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more on salaries, check out our gallery below to learn&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>who is the highest-paid judge on&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>America’s Got</span> Talent</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuZ2yBeYWOqZitZaOWt6K3jKyYpZmirnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boosie-badazz-san-diego-police-suck-my-dk-1234754852.html><span>←</span><span>Boosie Badazz Tells San Diego Police 'Suck My D**k' Following Arrest</span></a>
