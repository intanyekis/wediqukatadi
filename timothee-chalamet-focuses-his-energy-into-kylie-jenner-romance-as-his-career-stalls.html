This followed a prior walkout by Hollywood screenwriters on May 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>News of Kylie and Timothee's romance made headlines before they were seen together as a couple, although Kylie's car had been photographed at Timothee's residence several times over the past few months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, reports suggested that the pair's relationship was purely casual, especially considering Kylie's breakup with Travis Scott last year, who is the father of her two children.</p><p>"They are keeping things casual at this point," an insider dished to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in August. "It's not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothée and seeing where it goes.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It's been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships,” they continued. “It's new and exciting for Kylie and she's having a lot of fun."</p><p>To make matters more complicated, it’s been reported that Travis Scott is having a hard time seeing Kylie move on with Timothee.</p><p>“Travis is not thrilled about Kylie moving on, but they are still cordial and focused on co-parenting and being the best parents they can be,” <a href=#>a source told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>“Although Travis understands that Kylie is free to date whoever she wants, he’s not exactly ecstatic about the whole situation [with Timothée],” <a href=#>a different source told Us Weekly</a>. “Despite his feelings, Kylie and Travis have both been very mature about their split and are focused on co-parenting in a healthy manner.”</p><p>But with Timothee not booking any acting roles amid the ongoing strike, it looks like he and Kylie have a lot of time on their hand to build their romance. And judging by recent photos, the two are enjoying their time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Britney Spears Is Preparing For A Musical Comeback As Her $60 Million Fortune Remains At Stake Amid Divorce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqrnOrZ%2BenV2YtaK4wKacrWWWpLC2v8SsZKGho2Kyr7HRoLBmoZ6pvG632KWgnmWamruvsdFmqailkaOwpnnArGShoaNisKK%2BxJ6pZquklrmtv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lionel-richie-2022-amas-performance-icon-award-stevie-wonder-charlie-puth.html><span>←</span><span>Stevie Wonder &amp;amp; Charlie Puth Pay Tribute Hollywood Life</span></a>
