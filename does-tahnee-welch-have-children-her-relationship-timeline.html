This includes her <a href=#>relationship</a> with British actor Jared Harris, born just months prior to Tahnee, who goes by notable roles in Mad Men (Lane Pryce), The Crown (King George VI), The Expanse (Anderson Dawes) and more recently Morbius (Emil Nicholas).</p><p>Harris also played Valery Legasov in 2019’s Chernobyl series.
