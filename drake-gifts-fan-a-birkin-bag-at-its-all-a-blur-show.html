A second praised Drake for being so mindful of the fan’s safety and added, “can we talk about how he made sure the girl got security out the show to her car!?! the consideration this man has!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Drake-Gives-Fan-Birkin-Bag-2.jpg><p>This isn’t the first time Drake has been associated with the highly coveted accessory. In 2017, he revealed he has been <a href=#>collecting Birkin bags</a> through the years, “for the woman I end up with,” per <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Three years later, he shared his lavish collection with <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a>. In the cover story, fans caught a glimpse inside his two-story closet, which featured amethyst hardware and crystal details. On display were three Hermès bags, one of which looked like a Himalayan Crocodile Birkin — which is an <a href=#>extremely rare item</a> because only a few are manufactured each year. In order to purchase the bag, a customer must have an extensive history with Hermès. In 2016, a similar looking purse <a href=#>sold at auction</a> for $300,168.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>His other Birkins on display included a yellow crocodile bag and a large black and white design. In the background of the photo, more handbags could be seen on shelves.</p><p>At the time, Drake described his closet as “overwhelming high luxury.” He continued, “That message is delivered through the size of the rooms and the materials and details of the floors and the ceilings. I wanted to make sure people can see the work I’ve put in over the years reflected from every vantage point.”</p><p>Aside from his purse collection, Drake also had an array of<a href=#> sneakers on display</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5m%2ForfEZp6inqSoeqetzWaYZpqZp7iquoybmKBlkal6qsDSZpilpF2WeqO41KtkrKCfrHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chim-hwa-sa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-56169-html.html><span>←</span><span>Chim Hwa Sa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
