The two were introduced not by their famous fathers, but by Jasmin’s uncle, and became close friends before striking up a romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It wasn't even our dads, and they've done two movies together, they're friends," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasmin shared with InTouch Weekly in 2022</a>. “We met through my uncle, and we became really good friends, we bonded on a lot of things, obviously we have similar backgrounds, so we understood each other on a certain level and over time it just became more.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eric-murphy-and-jasmin-lawrence.jpg><p>Though it remains unclear exactly when the duo’s years-long romance started, it’s quite evident that they’re completely besotted with each other. In her interview with InTouch weekly, Jasmin couldn’t resist gushing about Eric, claiming that he wasn’t just her boyfriend, but her best friend as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He’s my best friend and it sounds cliché like you know you should be best friends but its so true like we just love each other’s company, we laugh together, a lot of laughing," she said.

The Dolemite Is My Name star has raised his brood far away from the glare of the spotlight, going as far as <a href=#>barring them from venturing into Hollywood until they're 18</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eddie-murphy-smiling.jpg><p>Given how close Jasmin and Eric have gotten over the years, it’s quite likely that they’ve met each other’s families. However, there doesn’t appear to be much cause for concern on this front, as Murphy has always been incredibly supportive of his kids’ relationships.</p><p>"My kids have made wonderful choices with their little friends and boyfriends and girlfriends, and it's been really cool," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he revealed to Entertainment Tonight</a> ahead of the premiere of his 2022 film, You People, in which he plays an overprotective dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/does-eddie-murphy-approve-of-his-son-eric-s-relationship-with-martin-lawrence-s-daughter-jasmine_.jpg><p>In fact, Murphy seems to have a pretty cordial relationship with his daughter Bria's husband, Michael Xavier, to whom she tied the knot in July 2022. “Her husband's a great guy and [he] respectfully came and talked to me first. Very old-fashioned and I didn't have any type of friction," he shared with ET. "No one's come home where I was like, 'Who the f**k is this you've come home with?'

"If that happened… I would go straight to the person that was not cool and say 'You get the f**k out of here!'" he said jokingly during his 2022 interview with ET. "And my kid would go, 'Hey, where's so and so?'
