Most of the original cast no longer work at the <a href=#>restaurant</a> despite still appearing on the show which left many wondering how much these people are now worth.</p><p>With a little help from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebrityNetworth</a>, we were able to track down the estimated net worths of some of our favorite cast members of&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=vanderpump-rules-newcomer-beau-clark-is-worth-an-estimated-400-000><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Vanderpump Rules Newcomer Beau Clark Is Worth An Estimated $400,000</span></h2><p>One of the&nbsp;newest addition to the&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;family is Beau Clark, Stassi's&nbsp;fiancé. In addition to starring on the show, Clark is also an actor casting assistant. In other words, he's no stranger to the Hollywood limelight. With all these endeavors combined, he is worth an estimated $400,000. We're sure he's going to get a pay raise from the show now that he's going to be sticking around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scheana-marie-is-worth-an-estimated-500-000><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Scheana Marie&nbsp;Is Worth An Estimated $500,000</span></h2><p>Scheana is one of the few original cast members who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still works at SUR</a> as a server. Between waitressing and starring in the series, Scheana is an actress and aspiring singer. Despite being one of the original cast members and having several side gigs, Scheana is one of the least wealthy cast members on the show.</p><h2 id=katie-maloney-is-worth-an-estimated-500-000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Katie Maloney Is Worth An Estimated $500,000</span></h2><p>It's no secret that Katie Maloney isn't rolling in the dough – you probably remember the episode where she and Tom went to sign a prenup with only a few dollars in their accounts. Still, Katie is worth more than many of us. In addition to starring on the show, Katie owns a popular blog and started a wine business with her two best friends.</p><h2 id=brittany-cartwright-is-worth-an-estimated-1-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Brittany Cartwright&nbsp;Is Worth An Estimated $1 Million</span></h2><p>Arguably one of the nicest cast members, Brittany Cartwright's net worth clocks in at&nbsp;an estimated $1 million making her worth more than some of the original cast members. Brittany has used her status on the show to become a social media influencer which has helped increase her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Related: <a href=#>One Vanderpump Star Is Eager For A Baby Bump, While Another Is Slimming Down</a></p><h2 id=ariana-madix-is-worth-an-estimated-1-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ariana&nbsp;Madix Is Worth An Estimated $1 Million</span></h2><p>Known on the show as the girl who hates marriage, Ariana Madix has a lot more going on then we might think. While it's assumed that most of her $1 million may have come from her time on&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules,&nbsp;Ariana also used her platform to create a cocktail book full of her own creations she'd come up with while working as a bartender at SUR.</p><h2 id=kristen-doute-is-worth-an-estimated-1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kristen Doute Is Worth An Estimated $1 Million</span></h2><p>Rounding out the $1 million club is resident mean girl, Kristen Doute. Despite not working at SUR for several years now, Kristen has maintained her cast member status on the reality TV show thanks to her drama starting antics. In addition to starring in the series, Kristen also runs&nbsp;the T-shirt company, James Mae.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jax-taylor-is-worth-an-estimated-2-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jax Taylor&nbsp;Is Worth An Estimated $2 Million</span></h2><p>Jax Taylor has been fired from SUR more times than we can count and yet he's one of the only cast members that's still working at the popular restaurant. While his main job seems to be starting drama on the show, he's been known to model and has even partnered with some brands for his own exclusive lines.</p><h2 id=lala-kent-is-worth-an-estimated-2-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lala Kent Is Worth An Estimated $2 Million</span></h2><p>Despite being engaged to a&nbsp;film producer worth an estimated $16 million, Lala Kent clocks in with an impressive $2 million. Lala started as the hostess at SUR and has since left the popular restaurant to pursue other endeavors like her own cosmetic line. Despite not working at the restaurant, she is still a part of the&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;cast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Things Vanderpump Rules' Lala Kent Wishes She Could Sweep Under The Rug</a></span></p><h2 id=stassi-schroeder-is-worth-an-estimated-2-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Stassi Schroeder Is Worth An Estimated $2 Million</span></h2><p>Stassi Schroeder has a bit of a tumultuous relationship with the&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;series. In fact, she quit filming for a year before she apologized for her behavior and ended up back on the show's cast list. Much of Stassi's net worth comes from her appearances on the show despite not working at SUR. In addition to reality TV, Stassi has also written a book and runs a successful podcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-sandoval-is-worth-an-estimated-4-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tom Sandoval&nbsp;Is Worth An Estimated $4 Million</span></h2><p>There's no doubt that part of Tom Sandoval's impressive $4 million net worth is thanks in part to his business deal with Lisa Vanderpump. With a little bit of hard work, Tom Sandoval went from bartending at SUR to partially owning West Hollywood's latest bar TomTom. We're dying to see what Sandoval spends some of that money on since we know he loves the finer things in life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanderpump Rules: 20 Photos Of The Cast From Season 1 To Now</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-schwartz-is-worth-an-estimated-4-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tom Schwartz Is Worth An Estimated $4 Million</span></h2><p>Interestingly enough, Tom Schwartz never actually worked at SUR to begin with. Instead, he got the job on&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;because he was dating Katie Maloney. Despite never proving he has what it takes to be a serious adult, Lisa Vanderpump offered him a business deal to go in on TomTom which Schwartz of course accepted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-vanderpump-is-worth-an-estimated-90-million-thanks-to-her-restaurant-empire><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lisa Vanderpump Is Worth An&nbsp;Estimated $90 Million Thanks To Her Restaurant Empire</span></h2><p>We don't think you'll be surprised to learn that Lisa Vanderpump is the wealthiest cast member on&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules.&nbsp;She's worth a whopping $90 million!&nbsp;Thanks to her successful&nbsp;restaurant empire. Lisa doesn't need to work another day in her life and yet she continues to because she loves it. One thing is for sure, she definitely doesn't need to be a cast member on&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&nbsp;to maintain her fortune.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Cast Of Vanderpump Rules Ranked From Crazy To Loveable</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitmqaUmr%2BxwcypZKutnJrAbq%2FArKtmqpGjuKawjJuwZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./silvia-fortini-and-roberto-mancini-married-life.html><span>←</span><span>How Is Roberto Mancini And His Second Wife Silvia Fortinis Married Life?
