But they have since begun producing films and TV shows, kicking that off five years ago. There are now several Netflix original movies and TV shows, and the company has garnered eight Oscar nominations so far.</p><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY:&nbsp;<a href=#>THINGS STEVEN SPIELBERG BOUGHT THAT WE CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF</a></strong></p><p>"You certainly, if it’s a good show, deserve an Emmy. But not an Oscar," he&nbsp;told&nbsp;ITV News.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, 2017 film Mudbound—directed by Lee Rees and starring Carey Mulligan,</p><p>Jason Clarke, Jason Mitchell, and&nbsp;Mary J. Blige pulled in four nominations at the Academy Awards for the best supporting actress, original song, adapted screenplay, and cinematography. Other shows to be nominated are&nbsp;Heroin(e),&nbsp;On Body and Soul and documentaries Icarus and Strong Island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spielberg, who has been in the business for over 40 years, is&nbsp;one of the co-founders of DreamWorks Studios. The icon has produced and or directed a myriad of screen hits. Among Spielberg's popular productions are Jaws, E.T, Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Indiana Jones movies, Jurrasic Park, and Saving Private Ryan.</p><p>His latest comes in the form of Ready Player One, an action/adventure&nbsp;from&nbsp;Warner Bros. And the 71-year-old reckons that easily accessible streaming services such as Netflix will make filmmakers less enthusiastic when it comes to raise money or submit their work to festivals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Fewer and fewer filmmakers are going to struggle to raise money or to go to compete at Sundance,” he said, referring to the annual film festival that goes on in Park City, Utah.</p><p>“More of them are going to let the SVOD businesses finance their films, maybe with the promise of a slight one-week theatrical window to qualify them for awards as a movie. But, in fact, once you commit to a television format, you’re a TV movie.”</p><p>He also pointed out that he didn't see the merit in movies receiving Academy nominations after being in theatres for less than a week.</p><p>Spielberg does admit that television is way better nowadays&nbsp;but still seems to think that it presents disadvantages to moviegoers. He has also confirmed that he will not be joining the trend and will keep away from making films with streaming services.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ll still make The Post for audiences asking them, 'Please to go out to the movies to see The Post,' and not make it directly for Netflix."</p><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>IS STEVEN SPIELBERG PRODUCING OR DIRECTING A MOVIE IN INDIA?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5no6myt7HNZqqpoZWhr6a%2BxmalnqyWoba5ecyoraKdXZbEor7DrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./407329-stepson-of-missing-titanic-sub-html.html><span>←</span><span>Stepson of Missing Titanic Sub Billionaire Attends Concert While Stepdad Is Still Being Searched For</span></a>
