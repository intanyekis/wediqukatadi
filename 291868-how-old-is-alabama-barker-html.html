They had longed for a time when they would share their vows and eventually blend their families.</p><p class=dh>Fans would recall the reality TV star gushing about her relationship with Travis on "The Kardashians." She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barkers-italian-wedding-photos/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I feel like I'm living in a fairy tale.

I've never in my whole life dreamt of getting married until Travis and until this relationship."</p><p class=dh>Thankfully, her husband's kids, as well as her own, are in support of the fairytale romance. This union makes fans wonder who Travis's kids are, especially the most popular and youngest among them all—Alabama.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HOW OLD IS ALABAMA BARKER?</strong></p><p class=dh>Alabama <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7977523/>was born</a> as Alabama Luella Barker in Calabasas, California. Her parents welcomed her a few hours before Christmas: on December 24, 2005, making her a Capricorn.</p><p class=dh>Judging by her zodiac sign, the 16-year-old is already exhibiting the rightful traits of a Capricorn: she is ambitious and persistent. Although there is no current tag on her net worth, she is a social media goddess with massive followers.</p><p class=dh>Another noteworthy fact about her is the meaning behind her unique name. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popbuzz.com/celeb/alabama-barker/>According</a> to Travis, he was inspired by his favorite movie "True Romance," where a character played Alabama Whitman.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALABAMA BARKER'S FAMILY</strong></p><p class=dh>As mentioned earlier, Alabama is not the only child of her parents. She has two other siblings. Her brother, Landon, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/1919313/kourtney-kardashian-husband-travis-barker-who/>was born</a> in 2003. He is a musician and social media influencer.</p><p class=dh>Her half-sister, Atiana De La Hoya, is the eldest of the brood. She was a product of Moakler's relationship with her ex-lover, Oscar De La Hoya.</p><p class=dh>The family's patriarch, Travis, is a notable drummer, musician, label owner, entrepreneur, and actor. However, he is not the only famous face in the household.</p><p class=dh>His ex-wife, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-shanna-moakler-4331460/>Moakler</a>, is also a well-known personality in the entertainment industry. She is a model and an actress. The mother-of-three was married to Travis from 2004 to 2008.</p><p class=dh>Following news of her ex-husband's romance with Kardashian, the model expressed that she finds their PDA odd. She has also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/photo-gallery/48262929/embed/48262943/Landon-Asher-Barker>displayed</a> her disapproval by liking a fan's comment that hinted that Travis made a downgrade with his new lover.</p><p class=dh>Before their divorce, the former couple and their kids spent time with the Kardashians. They were so close that they even featured in the initial episodes of "KUWTK."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALABAMA BARKER DEBUTED ON "MEET THE BARKERS"</strong></p><p class=dh>Alabama's first time on TV was as an infant. She featured in her family's reality show "Meet The Barkers" during the Christmas episode in 2005.</p><p class=dh>The MTV show produced only two seasons, airing between 2005 to 2006. Other stars in the series included Atiana, Landon as a toddler, his parents, and later, Alabama.</p><p class=dh>Travis's daughter has also appeared in other TV features, including "E! Live From The Red Carpet," "Kids React," and "The Kardashians."</p><p class=dh>The young <a class="me a" href=#>Barker</a> is also a singer. In 2017, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popbuzz.com/celeb/alabama-barker/>released</a> her debut single titled "Our House." This was a song that her dad and two other adults helped her compose.</p><p class=dh>Although Alabama is doing less music and more influencing today, she is a wiz at the game! At 16, she has an ambassadorship deal and a pool of fans reaching 1.4 million on Instagram and 2.5 million on TikTok. That's not all; her content on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.tiktok.com/@alabamabarker?refer=embed">TikTok</a> has received more than seventy million likes!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwanBmbXqpu9ZmpqWcXZ7Abq3LmpmapZFir6K%2Byp6pZ6Ckork%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-pete-davidsons-girlfriend-chase-sui-wonders-say-about-exes-kim-kardashian-and-ariana-grande.html><span>←</span><span>How Does Pete Davidson's Girlfriend Chase Sui Wonders Really Feel About His Famous Exes Kim Kardashi</span></a>
