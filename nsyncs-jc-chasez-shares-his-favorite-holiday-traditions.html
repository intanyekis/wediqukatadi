Same section of the Nativity, and then when it comes to the carols, we usually let the kids in the family shout out whichever one they want to hear next. Then we all hop to it.”</p><p>Chasez even plays it simple when it comes to the food he enjoys at the get-togethers. “I’m not really one or the other,” he dished. “If it’s home-cooked, I’m happy.”</p><p>The Maryland native also opened up about his former bandmate <a href=#><strong>Justin Timberlake’s</strong></a> success and recently released memoir, Hindsight.</p><p>“I just took a look through it. I haven’t read it in depth, I just did the flip of the pages,” Chasez told Us. “Look, it’s a fun thing to look over. The guy has had an amazing career, come on. It was fun to see to some of the past in there that I was a part of with the Mickey Mouse Club. Then the early days of the ‘NSyncstuff.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He gushed: “It’s inspiring to see the stuff he did later in life, really breaking through … becoming a movie star himself and things like that.”</p><p><i>With reporting by Nicholas White&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanq6mjsLR5yZxknKCRqLK7edKhmKudo2K1qr%2BMn5ivp6KewaZ5x6ijopyRrnq1vsCdoK2hn6PAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./245556-montel-williams-is-a-renowned-american-t-html.html><span>←</span><span>Montel Williams Is a Renowned American Television Host Glimpse into His Life Today</span></a>
