<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Rae Dawn Chong Oprah Winfrey Slam: Call Her &amp;quot;Vile,&amp;quot; N-Word</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a> is not one of <strong>Rae Dawn Chong</strong>'s favorite things. The talk show icon, 59, and 80s actress, 52, costarred in 1985's The Color Purple, and Chong looked back on her dynamic with Winfrey in a shocking chat with Matty P’s Radio Happy Hour laced with expletives and shocking references to slavery.</p><p>While Winfrey was "lovely" on the set of the <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>'s film, Chong recalled, Winfrey became a "total biotch" when Chong landed a role in <a href=#><strong>Arnold Schwarzenneger</strong></a>'s action film Commando. "She just wasn't having me," Chong, the daughter of comic actor Tommy Chong, said. "She's competitive. She didn't like me."</p><p>During her rant — first unearthed by <a href=#>TMZ</a> — Chong then called Winfrey a "great brownnoser. If you go into a room with her she will pick the most powerful person and will become best friends with them. . . Whe was the fat chick in school that did everything and everyone loved her. That's Oprah."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Continuing to slam Winfrey's appearance, she added, "If you look at the way [Oprah] looks, she looks like 60 years ago she would have been a house keeper luckily." In her most disturbing insult, she added that Winfrey would have been a "house [n-word] back in the slave days."</p><p>Despite the slew of insults, the Soul Man actress wrapped up her chat with a compliment. "We have to give her props. This woman is a miracle and I respect her and I say kudos to you, and I don't give two cents about the other parts of it. She shifted the DNA in terms of our thinking of a woman of a certain size and a certain shade. I love her for that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmZVisaLDzWaaoaeenHq0uMCmqmanoKeuqXnWoqWfqpWueqW%2BzqmqZqZdrLyzsIyipWaumZi2sMHSZqmapqRif3F9kmpwcGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-lee.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Lee Age, Net worth: Weight, Wife, Bio-Wiki, Kids</span></a>
