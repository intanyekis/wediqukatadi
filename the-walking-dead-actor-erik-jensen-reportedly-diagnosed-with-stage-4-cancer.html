Blank reveals that the cancer had metastasized to Jensen’s liver.&nbsp; She writes the health diagnosis happened a little over a year and a half after Jensen survived a brain aneurysm.&nbsp;</p><p>“The cancer has metastasized to his liver,” Erik Jensen’s wife explains on the donation page. “But Erik is young and strong (cutting a film during chemo, working full-time as a director and writer throughout).”</p><p>Blank further describes Jensen as being incredibly resilient and strong. “Erik is a survivor. We know he can make it through this, come out the other side, and continue to make great work and support his community for years to come.”</p><p>Blank notes that due to the strikes and nonexistence of streaming residuals, the family faces a risk of losing insurance and even their home.&nbsp;“Erik and Jess are devoted to creating community and supporting that community,” she writes. “But this is a time when they need community support.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-erik-jensen-and-family-remain-optimistic-as-doctors-plan-to-shrink-tumors-long-enough-for-two-major-surgeries-nbsp>Erik Jensen and Family Remain Optimistic As Doctors Plan to Shrink Tumors Long Enough For Two Major Surgeries&nbsp;</h2><p>Although the diagnosis is absolutely terrifying, Erik Jensen and his family are continuing to remain pretty optimistic. His wife states he is determined to make it through the health ordeal. He is also working hard to stay positive.</p><p>“His doctors have a shot at shrinking the tumors enough to do two very major surgeries and get them all out,” Blank explains. She also writes that while the news can be scary, the family would greatly appreciate communications of success stories, positivity, and hope.&nbsp;</p><p>“Erik is young, with a beloved family, and has so much more good work to do in this world,” Blank adds. “Erik can survive this– but they won’t be able to make it through without support. We are so grateful in advance for whatever you can give.”</p><p>The GoFundMe is now seeking $300,000 so that Jensen’s family can make it through the next year. The funds will go towards paying for his treatment, keeping the family home, and maintaining some form of stability for Jensen and Blank’s 13-year-old daughter, Sadie.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the GoFundMe has raised more than $100,000. Among those who have donated to the cause include Scott M. Gimple and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51ku6bD0miroZ1drK6tt8innmaclZaxbq3CraarZZWntqx5yZ6lrJ2eYr%2BmvM6rq56cnK56pbXAoKWoq5WZeri106FkrKyRnLJugIycmKeblad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-canha-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-158153-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Canha Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
