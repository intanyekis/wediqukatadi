I smoked a little spice, which is like man-made pot. It’s not like I went wild and overdosed. I just had a weird reaction, a seizure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Though the Indecent Proposal star claimed not to have over-indulged, she ended up having a rather unexpected reaction to the drugs.</p><p>“Everything went blurry and I could see myself from above. I was floating out of my body into swirling colors, and it seemed like maybe this was my chance: I could leave the pain and shame of my life behind. The headaches and the heartbreak and the sense of failure—as a mother, a wife, and a woman—would just evaporate.”</p><p>In her memoir, Moore delves into the emotional toll the incident took on her family, particularly her daughter Rumer, who was also at the party.</p><p>“I scared Rumer so badly when she saw me there, semiconscious on the floor; she thought I might die in front of her. She was completely freaked out, and after that night she joined her younger sisters in refusing to speak to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Demi Moore And Bruce Willis Are So Close, Demi Reportedly Moved In Amid His Diagnosis">Demi Moore And Bruce Willis Are So Close, Demi Reportedly Moved In Amid His Diagnosis</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Bruce Willis' dementia diagnosis reportedly brought him closer to his ex-wife Demi Moore.</p><p>Isolated from her family and too sick to work, Moore had to face the brutal aftermath of her divorce alone.</p><p>“I was in so much pain, physically as well as emotionally, I could barely function. I rarely left the house, except to let the dogs out,” she shared in her memoir. “That feeling of not being anchored by all of these people’s needs and my role as their nurturer was unbearable. Not a lot was going on in my career, and even if there had been, I was too sick to work. I had no choice but just to be with myself, and I hated it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqWZYrqwu9GeZJqrmKm8r3nKrqucoJWneqW11aipnJ1dnbKiuNOhZKKro6qytHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cardi-b-gifts-offset-a-2-million-check-on-his-30th-birthday.html><span>←</span><span>Cardi B Gifts Offset A $2 Million Check On His 30th Birthday</span></a>
