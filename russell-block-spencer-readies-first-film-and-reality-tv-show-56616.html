Block recalled how a chance meeting blossomed into a partnership<span>.<br></span></p><p>“We both have a mutual friend in common by the name of Kevin Liles and really our bond came natural. We had a great vibe and everything started with a handshake and went on from there.”</p><p>The Atlanta based business tycoon’s first film and soundtrack, titled Frienemies, are set to go into production in 2011, <span>which Block described in his own words.</span></p><p>“Now you rarely see movies that come from the hip-hop world, that’s how Frienemies came about, and I think it’s relevant at this time. A lot of people have friends in this entertainment game and in anything from music, sports, anything successful—sometimes your best friend hates you.”</p><p>Block’s also in the process of wrapping up the filming of his new reality show, The Player’s Club, a new series on how DJ’s break records and artists in the strip clubs.</p><p>“We don’t break records anymore; Ceo’s don’t break records anymore in the board rooms of New York City or LA no more.” He’s looking&nbsp; at a March 2011 release date, “I want to go to HBO with it cause I want to be able to show the real deal in depth. I know MTV most definitely will have to cut like 30% out, and I really like just showing reality.”</p><p>If all these new ventures weren’t enough, Block is also coming back with some new artists, who include All Star The Great (ADG), hailing from New Jersey and Shane Mosely repping North Carolina. Through his E1 Entertainment and Atlantic Records partnerships, the hip-hop mogul is looking to add another chapter to his story. —Storm</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6fCtL%2FEpaNmmpyksKx50qmcp5uVp3qzscCdoJ6rXZu2s7%2FTZp2ipJ1irq%2BwjKucmqSZqcZuwNVmqqGnp2KCd4KQb2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miriam-mcdonald-degrassi-made-emma-anorexic-amid-my-irl-battle.html><span>←</span><span>Miriam McDonald: Degrassi Made Emma Anorexic Amid My IRL Battle</span></a>
