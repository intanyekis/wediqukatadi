First you'll need some equipment. A collector limpet controller which supports at least three simultaneous limpets on the field at once (speed is important here), plus around six limpets per run at the station. I did two runs before restocking in my explorer-fitted Phantom, so twelve in total in my case. You'll also need at least four heat sinks and around 25-35T of cargo space per run. A module reinforcement package might help, as I had one, though I believe I was efficient enough with my heat sinks that I'm not sure if it did anything.<p>Now find a damaged station on your Galmap and jump to it. These can be toggled on and off on the rightmost tab on the left hand panel. There are usually at least two or three available at one time, sometimes more. When you arrive, soak in the terror then request docking. Deploy your cargo hatch and go in as fast as possible until you're near the midpoint of the station. Now unleash your collectors to fetch the salvage and deploy your heat sinks when heat levels begin to damage your internals (100%) as your cargo hatch will begin to malfunction after basking in the flames for too long, dropping your precious loot and racking up fines and frustration.</p><p>After deploying your fourth heat sink, your limpets should be just about done, so hightail it out of there, cancel your docking request and if you've prepped for more than one run, relog and do the station again until you're ready to hand in the salvage to your nearest station.</p><p>Note that handing your cargo over to any nearby rescue ships will severely limit your hard-earned profits, or at least it did in my case. I made about 500k per run selling to a station compared to 50k selling to the rescue ship. As the ship is likely a LOT closer however, if you're not concerned about credits, use the ship for sake of speed and efficiency.</p><p>This method should net around four black boxes, five personal effects and ten occupied escape pods per run.</p><p>Godspeed and fly frosty!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tb7UnpicoJmaw6a5xKerrGaTpLpwrZFtaGtsY2S%2FpsHNoquenF2Wu6V5yK1kn52VocBuv85mnqinlGKupLTInq2epZWjwQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./original-good-times-cast-members-share-reaction-animated-reboot-1234867057.html><span>←</span><span>Original 'Good Times' Cast Members Share Reaction To Animated Reboot</span></a>
