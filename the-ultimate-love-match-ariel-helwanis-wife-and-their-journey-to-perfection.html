<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Ariel Helwani's Wife and their Journey to Perfection</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>An acclaimed combat sports journalist, <strong>Ariel Helwani</strong> is distinctively known for his coverage of mixed martial arts (MMA). Helwani has been keeping fans updated on the world of MMA since 2009 when he launched his weekly show, <i>The MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani.</i> &nbsp;</p><p>Born on July 8, 1982, in Monreal, Canada, Ariel's career began with HBO, where he bagged the position of sports production assistant after a year internship. Ariel gradually found his calling in MMA and landed his break after he started working for MMA Fighting.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ariel Helwani is Married to Jaclyn Stein! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Ariel Helwani is famous amongst sports enthusiasts for many things. Be it his excellent reporting and interviews, or his long-standing feuds with influential sports figure, including <strong>Dana White.</strong> So far in his career, Helwani has never led his personal life come under the public scrutiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/4/292968447_754955368985753_7417740792312163852_n%20(1)-1704358492270.jpg><p>Ariel couldn't be more forthright and vociferous when things are work-related, but the award-winning sports journalist prefers keeping his family from the media theatrics that he is usually involved in. &nbsp;</p><p>If that sounds like an approach a perfect couple would adapt, then Ariel and his wife surely are the epitome of perfection, especially in an industry that has the tendency to break marriages, and relationships if one is not careful.&nbsp;</p><p>The Montreal-born journalist is married to <strong>Jaclyn Stein</strong>, who from what we know, is accomplished in her own right. Helwani may not go around rubbing his blissful married life on people's face, but he is certainly proud of the life he and his wife have created for themselves. &nbsp;</p><p>On his Twitter bio, Ariel describes himself as a "proud husband and father of three." Helwani, who will be turning 42 this year, was in his 20s, and had yet to made it in the industry when he started dating Stein. The pair walked down the aisle on October 25, 2008, almost a year before Helwani broke through the sports journalism with his stint on MMA. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani</i> fame and his wife have since welcomed three kids, who are also being raised away from the public eye. The couple received their Amercian citizenship in March 2022. Helwani rarely talks about his family, but he doesn't shy away from giving tributes when its due. &nbsp;</p><h2>What to Know About Ariel Helwani's Wife, Jaclyn Stein? &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>If every successful man does have a woman behind him, then in Ariel's case, it's his wife, Jacelyn Stein, the woman who has been with him from the start. But tending to her perennially busy husband and kids isn't all that Stein has been doing. Stein runs a successful jewelry business and is an ardent advocate of cancer awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/4/292199562_1331824647346876_5886213727356923677_n%20(1)-1704358499865.jpg><p>A graduate of McGill University, Stein, along with her family started a jewelry business, Anzie Jewelry, in 1999. Named after her mother, the jewelry line was started by the Stein women, which includes Jacyln, her mom, and sister, <strong>Joanna,</strong> after they learned about their father's colon cancer diagnosis. &nbsp;</p><p>While talking about doing business with family, Stein shared, "We all give our input in each area, but it's important to have distinct roles." Ariel's wife is a woman of many talents it seems as she works as an illustrator and designed for Mirth Meets Earth. &nbsp;</p><h3>Ariel Helwani's Three Kids! &nbsp;</h3><p>Ariel and Jaclyn are doting parents of three but rarely do the couple give update on their parenting journey. The pair have been so discreet in their personal journey that they've opted to keep their kids' names a secret. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/4/292200109_724075598825631_8098243940521850110_n%20(1)-1704358506518.jpg><p>While Helwani almost never gives fans any visual insight into his family life, Stein cherishes her kids' childhood on her Instagram. The duo share two older sons and one daughter, who, as per Jaclyn's many posts, is named <strong>Claire.</strong> Head to <a href=#>Stein's Instagram </a>to witness Helwani family's love adventures. &nbsp;</p><h3>Arien Helwani on Fatherhood! &nbsp;</h3><p>Helwani takes much pride in doing what he does, and the eminent journalist couldn't be happier when he shared that his kids were hitting the age when they begin to understand their father's job. In one of his rare interviews, the consecutive World MMA Award-winner shared a heartwamning anecdote of his kids. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/4/292364461_3223519001250946_4368697873906689315_n%20(1)-1704358513464.jpg><p>"Last year, we went to my middle son's school, and there was this whole project thing," Helwani starts before sharing how his son wrote he wanted to "interview people" when he grows up. "They're proud, they think my job is cool," said the doting father. &nbsp;</p><p>The MMA journalist also spilled a little something about his daughter. Helwani says he is already equipping his kids to grow up in the tech-bound world. He goes on to reveal that his daughter has a microphone and a YouTube channel that he won't publicize. "She may be really good, but her dad, her dad wants to be the best,"<a href=#> says</a> the legendary journalist. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to<a href=#> Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq2fnmWlocGqucCtnGakn6uybrnArZqhZZGntqa4jKGcpa%2BRo7a0edainZ5lkaOxbsDHnqCrZZqkwrO6xLJkraddpbKzssScq6Knng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-inside-frank-oceans-personal-life-and-net-worth-coachella-performance-dropout.html><span>←</span><span>A Look Inside Frank Ocean's Personal Life And Net Worth (Including How Much Money He Lost From Coach</span></a>
