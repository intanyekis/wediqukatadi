The '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Idol</a>' judge was slammed by fans online after she seemingly decided to announce the winner for this season way before the finale.</p><p>The "Judge's Song Contest" returned to 'American Idol' on May 1 as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Bryan</a>, Katy, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lionel Richie</a> each selected songs for the participants to pick from. From coast to coast, America voted for the Top 7 live. But when the judges heard a performance so good, they couldn't help but already crown them the winner. However, all emotions aside, looks like this jumping-the-gun situation from Judge Katy didn't sit well with the fans.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Haven't slept in days': Katy Perry gives 'American Idol' fans a sneak peek into her life amid backlash</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Internet accuses Colin Stough of supporting 'Confederate flag' over his 'racist' resurfaced post</a></p><h2 class=split>Katy crowns Iam the winner</h2><p>Initially, Iam Tongi preferred Extreme's "More Than Words." However, his vocal coach persuaded him to cover Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World." He was frightened of not doing it justice. The song is overplayed in singing competitions, although it, like 'Hallelujah,' is a big vote-getter. He ends up delivering a strong rendition of the classic and the audience erupts in applause.</p><p>Iam guessed that Lionel must have picked the song, but it turned out to be Luke. Iam, according to Luke, "knocked it out of the park." "I prayed you would do that for us," he added. "That song just felt like the right time, the right moment." "You dragged us in…you have us on the first note…a phenomenon…very very special," Lionel added.</p><p>"When you win ‘American Idol’ will you please just sing ‘More Than Words’ for me?" Katy pleaded.</p><h2 class=split>'Katy's praise tipped the scales'</h2><p>Seeing Katy's comment, a viewer wrote, "Tongi is a one trick pony. Katy's praise tipped the scales." Another angry fan tweeted, "The judges R once again trying 2 shove their pick 4 winner down our throats. Katy twice tonite made comments that were unfair 2 others incl “WhenU win American Idol..” & after WéAni sang? He’s good but she’s in another realm. So unfair. Producers shud stop that!" Another fan quipped, "we ani fans katy not on your team." A fourth person tweeted, "katy telling iam he’s gonna win." One Twitter user also observed, "Weird that Iam Tongi is one of the favorites to win #AmericanIdol , lives in Federal Way, WA. But Seattle’s ABC affiliate @komonews won’t show the live coast-to-coast."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tongi is a one trick pony.
