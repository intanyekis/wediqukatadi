Unless I'm going to go on to just read all nice things about myself, which also feels like another kind of unhealthy thing to do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Radcliffe concluded by admitting that he doesn’t believe he’s “mentally strong enough” to handle social media, which he’s “all right with” for the time being.</p><h2 id=what-effect-have-negative-public-opinions-had-on-daniel-radcliffe>What Effect Have Negative Public Opinions Had On Daniel Radcliffe?</h2><p>Though to many people Daniel Radcliffe’s life seems perfect, he has had to deal with a lot of personal challenges that have stemmed from being so famous and successful, including a <a href=#>terrifying first experience on the red carpet</a>. And many of them struck his life when he was still young, limiting his capacity to deal with them in a health way.</p><p>In an interview with The Off Camera Show (via Cheat Sheet), Radcliffe shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he found being booed by fans really difficult to deal with when he was a kid.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Harry Potter Star Never Wanted To Be Part Of The Franchise, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p>“There are professional hunters in the world, and they make money off that, and I don’t hate that,” he explained. “There are some people who can do it and will go about it in a way that is OK, and … and it’s fine, but there are also some people who will boo and shout at a child.”</p><p>He added, “But at that moment, if you just hear people booing and shouting stuff at you and about you, that, as a kid, sucked.
