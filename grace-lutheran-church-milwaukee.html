According to the police, it stated that a Milwaukee man was late for his jury duty. He was rashly driving and broke the signal when it turned red.&nbsp;</p><p>The car lost its grip on the road and crashed with the car of Aaron when he was inside. Due to the impact caused by the crash, Strong’s car toppled onto nearby vehicles in the parking lot.&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron was rushed to the hospital but couldn’t survive. The father of the two young children and pastor of the Milwaukee church died.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aaron Strong Death Case</h2><p>The case was handed to the court, where the prosecutor said the driver’s name was Jose Silva. A 22-year-old man was recently inducted into jury duty.&nbsp;</p><p>During the trial, Silva told the honorable judge that he was not rash driving. Instead, he was overspeeding and had not broken the signal, as the signal light was yellow.&nbsp;</p><p>Silva persisted in staying with the answer, but data from Silva’s airbag module was shared in the court. The data showed that Silva was driving at 70 mph on a 30mph street.&nbsp;</p><p>Silva also mentioned that the signal was yellow when he passed, but the data showed that he broke the signal as it was red.&nbsp;</p><p>Hackmann said, “<strong>There is a hole in people’s hearts, and there is profound sorrow that people are feeling currently after his death</strong>.”</p><p>On 9 Oct, Strong delivered his last sermon in the Church. The speech was similar to the sermons Strong did previously. He looked at the visitors and smiled. He would usually smile during his daily sidewalks.&nbsp;</p><p>People said that he would often be in the lobby to greet the visitors, but “<strong>now the days won’t be same after his absence.</strong>“</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aaron Strong’s Funeral</h2><p>After the death of pastor Aaron, his funeral day was scheduled to take place on Wednesday. The officials of the Church of Milwaukee are making arrangements before his funeral.&nbsp;</p><p>It is estimated that Aaron’s funeral would invite an overload of visitors.
