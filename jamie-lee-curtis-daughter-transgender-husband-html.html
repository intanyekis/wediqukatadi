Among all the contemporary beliefs, the most significant idea she ditched was that gender is fixed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Elaborating further, Curtis disclosed her youngest child was transgender. She told the magazine that she and her husband "watched in wonder and pride" as their son became their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>The mother-of-two also spilled the beans on her daughter's relationship status. Revealing she was engaged, Curtis announced Ruby would marry her fiancé in 2022 and that she will officiate their wedding.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>25-year-old Ruby works as a computer gaming editor. Her elder sister,&nbsp;34-year-old Annie, is already married and works as a dance instructor.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While none of her kids have children yet, Curtis hopes to be a grandmother soon. She described her life as a constant metamorphosis, ready to change and adapt to new roles.&nbsp;</p><p>The BAFTA award-winning <a href=# rel=follow>actress</a>&nbsp;changed her lifestyle and subdued&nbsp;her acting career to raise her two children with her husband Guest, with whom she fell in&nbsp;love with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">at first sight</a> through a picture in 1984.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Back then, she called his agent, gave her number, and told him to have Guest call her. But, to her dismay, the&nbsp;Best in Show director didn't call, and she went to have a short fling with another man.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Coincidentally, she met Guest at&nbsp;Hugo's restaurant in West Hollywood right after her breakup, and this time, she caught his eyes.&nbsp;She got her long-awaited desire just after a day. Just like that, they went on their first date at&nbsp;Chianti Ristorante on Melrose on July 2, 1984.&nbsp;</p><p>On December that year, the pair married. They celebrated their 36th marriage anniversary in December 2020.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>A Supporter of the&nbsp;LGBTQ Community</h2><p>Curtis has always been an <a href=# rel=follow>ally of the LGBTQ community</a> and held compassion for them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Growing up with famous actress mother&nbsp;Janet Leigh and legendary father&nbsp;Tony Curtis and their gay friends, the 62-year-old was introduced to a unique orientation spectrum from a young age.</p><p>Her compassion for people with different romantic inclinations only strengthened because of her best friend the&nbsp;late&nbsp;Rick Frank, who was gay, and other&nbsp;family&nbsp;members who became a member of the LGBTQ community.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Pride Source</a> in November 2019 how she could feel the need for justice and equality for all LGBTQ+ members though she was straight. She even opined asking about people's inclination was reverse discrimination.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The California native stated that it shouldn't be anybody's business to ask other's romantic preference.&nbsp;</p><p>People’s private lives are their private lives and whether I’ve ever kissed a girl – have not – is irrelevant to whatever advocacy I participate in.&nbsp;</p><p>As a supporter, Curtis has openly used her art and voice to advocate normalcy regarding genders. She is "happy to represent whatever aspect of hope" she can spur on her audience.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRoramecuenGabpafBqr%2BMnZiun5ipsrN506uYp6uXmrulsdFmn66rkpa7pXrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./domenico-dolce-and-stefano-gabbana.html><span>←</span><span>Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family,</span></a>
