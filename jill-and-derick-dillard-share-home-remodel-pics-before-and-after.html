It’s been a crazy several weeks for us, but <a href=#>we are finally settling into our new place</a>!” the couple wrote <a href=#>via their Dillard Family blog</a> on Saturday, June 4, explaining that Derek, 33, started a new job as a prosecutor in Oklahoma shortly <a href=#>after being sworn in as an attorney</a> in their home state of Arkansas. “In between all of that, we <a href=#>bought a home on the Arkansas/Oklahoma border</a> (in Siloam Springs), had a few renovations done and then moved in.”</p><p>The certified midwife, 31, <a href=#>who is pregnant with her third child</a>, added that they wanted to get everything settled before their son’s birth. “We’ve been settling in the last couple of weeks and trying to get all the things in order before our baby boy (still no name yet!) is set to arrive next month!” The little one will <a href=#>join older brothers Israel, 7, and Samuel, 4</a>.</p><p>The post concluded: “We appreciate all the prayers during this crazy and exciting season of transition!”</p><p>Along with their big announcement, the Dillards shared photos from the past few weeks on their blog, <a href=#>including Derick’s swearing-in ceremony</a> and a trip to the Stilwell, Oklahoma, strawberry festival. The duo also included <a href=#>before-and-after photos of their home remodel</a>. The Dillards upgraded their kitchen with new, white cabinets and a stainless-steel fridge to match their dishwasher. Both bedrooms also got a fresh look with white walls, ready for the family to put their own stamp on them.</p><p>Jill and Derick’s move comes just over one week after her older brother <a href=#><strong>Josh Duggar</strong></a> was <a href=#>sentenced to more than 12 years in prison</a> after being convicted on child pornography charges. “The last several weeks and months have been difficult emotionally,” the couple wrote in a blog post last month, following the former car salesman’s sentencing. “Yesterday was another one of those hard days. We are <a href=#>neither rejoicing nor disappointed by the sentence</a>, but we are thankful it’s finally over.”</p><p>The statement continued: “The Bible clearly states that God effects justice and vengeance through the governing authorities. Though some believe <a href=#>Josh should have received a greater sentence</a> and still fewer believe he should have received a lighter sentence, God has carried out his vengeance today for his unspeakable criminal activity.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Josh, 34, was <a href=#>arrested without bail in April 2021</a> and was <a href=#>convicted the following December on two counts</a> of possessing and receiving child pornography. He was sentenced to 151 months in prison in May.</p><p>The day after the verdict was announced, Jill and Derick wrote that they hoped <a href=#>Josh’s time behind bars would allow him to get the treatment</a> he needs in order to “change his dangerous pattern of behavior.” They added, “It is unfortunate, but it seems that it may take spending over a decade in federal prison, and still more on probation, for <a href=#>Josh to have any potential for rehabilitation</a> to the point he can safely live in society again. … We continue to love Josh and his family and will be there for them however we can.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the how the Dillard family has started over with their new home remodel:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6q4y2aYp5xdmbKztcKkZJ2hnKGus7CMrJ%2BaqpVitbC5xGapnqWfmbKtec%2BimqxlkpqzsL7EZpinnF2Ws7Wx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erykah-badu-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Erykah Badu Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
