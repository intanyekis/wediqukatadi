Apart from hosting shows like "Dr. Drew on Call" and "Access Hollywood Live," he has taken acting gigs in "Where the Bears Are!" and "The Thing About Harry."</p><p class=Fg>Another interesting aspect of Karamo Brown is that he has two sons: one adopted, Chris, and one biological, Jason. In an interview with <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/moms-dads/queer-eye-star-karamo-brown-opens-up-about-discovering-he-had/>Parents</a>, Karamo explained how he learned that Jason was his son ten years after he was born.</p><p class=Fg>The TV personality revealed that he came out as a proud, gay man when he was 16 years old. However, while in high school, he was romantically involved with a woman who got pregnant.</p><p class=Fg>Speaking of Karamo's come-out story, he once admitted that <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/karamo-brown-relationship-father-came-out-gay/>his relationship with his father</a> took a serious tool after learning that he was gay. He even said that it "split the family apart" and that they didn't talk to each other for ten years.</p><p class=Fg>The TV personality remained hopeful that they could solve their problems, though, and Karamo's dad eventually contacted him and apologized for what happened. The man even supported his son by attending one of his "<a class="Xd a" href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>" performances in 2019!</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>JASON, KARAMO BROWN'S SON</strong></p><p class=Fg>Coming back to Jason's mother, she chose not to tell the then-15-year-old Karamo about her pregnancy. Instead, she moved away, and they never contacted each other again.</p><p class=Fg>Ten years later, after "The Real World: Philadelphia" made Karamo famous, he received a subpoena for child support.</p><p class=Fg>Karamo admitted to feeling everything from confused, sad, lost, and angry about it. However, he was "weirdly excited" about being a dad, as well. About Jason's mother, he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/moms-dads/queer-eye-star-karamo-brown-opens-up-about-discovering-he-had/>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"We were both kids and don't blame her for the decision she made because the choice was not hers; it was the adults around us."</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>KARAMO ADOPTED JASON'S HALF-BROTHER</strong></p><p class=Fg>Shortly after that, Karamo Brown took full custody of his son. The TV host confessed that getting to know Jason took time and that it was not always easy. Fortunately, he got the support of Jason's mother to help them connect in the best way.</p><p class=Fg>Early on, Karamo learned that Jason had a half-brother, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxPYfliQZDU">Chris</a>. Since he wanted to keep the family unit, he officially took legal guardianship of him in 2011. Such a drastic change in his life made him step away from the public eye and focus on his sons.</p><p class=Fg>In terms of parenting, Karamo admitted that it was hard. He said that adjusting his life to all the new aspects that came with his children – school, homework, friends, diets – was overwhelming at times.</p><p class=Fg>Nowadays, both of Karamo Brown kids are old enough to take care of themselves and their household, which is why their father has been move involved in his career lately.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>IAN JORDAN, KARAMO BROWN'S FIANCÉ</strong></p><p class=Fg>As per Karamo's love life, he has been engaged to TV director <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/queer-eye-karamo-brown-engaged/>Ian Jordan</a> since 2018. Ian was a talent coordinator for popular shows like "Drake & Josh," "All That," and "Zoe 101."</p><p class=Fg>The couple made headlines in May this year after <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/826587/queer-eye-star-karamo-brown-re-proposes-ian-jordan/>Karamo re-proposed</a> to his husband-to-be. They had plans to tie the knot on October 10, 2020, but the novel coronavirus pandemic forced them to postpone the ceremony.</p><p class=Fg>At the moment, it is unclear when the pair will finally walk down the aisle. In the meantime, Karamo Brown has his hands full, being one of the main stars of "<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/karamo-queer-eye-interview>Queer Eye</a>" and taking other gigs in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtobmlma3qsrdGapKhlkqe8uLqMqqyenaJisrqxjJ2grJufq7KzscNmn55lmJaxb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-sweeto-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Sweeto Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
