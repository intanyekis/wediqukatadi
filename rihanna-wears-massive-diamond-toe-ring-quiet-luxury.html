Rihanna’s take on the aesthetic, however, isn’t exactly quiet.&nbsp;</span></p><a title=@rihanna href=#>@rihanna</a><p>quiet luxury</p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Rihanna" href=#>♬ original sound – Rihanna</a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Nonetheless, her video prompted excited reactions from her fans. “Oh, to be as rich as Rihanna,” wrote one of her followers in the comments section as a second quipped, “Rihanna rocks a toe ring, so I went out and bought a toe ring.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Others questioned if the gem signified a new chapter for Rihanna and her boyfriend, ASAP Rocky. “Is this … an engagement announcement??” read a comment. A different fan added, “She got her engagement ring on her TOE!!!! Love her.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The lovebirds — who are currently expecting their second child together — <a href=#>had been friends</a> for years before sparking a romantic relationship in November 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, the couple celebrated their son <a href=#>RZA’s 1st birthday</a> —&nbsp;and confirmed the origin of the little one’s name.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“‘WU TANG IZ 4 DA CHUREN&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>🤲</span><span class=s1>’ HAPPY 1st BIRTHDAY TO MY 1st BORN .

In one, the little boy was cradled in his dad’s arm as he watched Rocky shave. In another, Rihanna held their son in her arms as the “Praise the Lord” crooner snapped the photo. In one particularly sweet clip, Rocky held RZA up to the camera to get some adorable close-ups of their son. The New York native concluded the post with footage of Ol’ Dirty Bastard uttering the iconic sentiment, “Wu-Tang Clan is for the children.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Rocky’s sweet tribute to his son comes days after RZA’s name was first revealed.
