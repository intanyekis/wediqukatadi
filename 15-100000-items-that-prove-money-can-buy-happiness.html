Spending all your money in one place might not be wise, but this car is worth the purchase. The 2016 Dodge Viper GT is $95,895 with a V10 engine and according to Dodge, “generates 645 horsepower and twists of 600 pound-feet of torque." The doors are aluminum, and the dealership has a list of 19-inch aluminum rims for you to choose. Cotton car seating is a no-no in this sports vehicle. The finest leather is available in multiple colors handcrafted to perfection. With an 8.4-inch touchscreen system, you can connect your mobile devices to Wi-Fi internet, turn the volume up on your HD radio, while using voice command to activate your favorite features. If you can stay under your $100,000 budget, ask the dealership to add a few more accessories that we are sure can bump up the cost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-own-a-private-island-anywhere-in-the-world><strong>14.

I have a better idea that will be worth your while.&nbsp;If you are infatuated with Brazilian women, this island is in the perfect place. The Piaçabuçu is a set of six islands located in Northern Brazil and is $80,000 with 81.58 acres. Many people may think that a private island is only a reality for the wealthy and famous, but this statement is false. It is true that <a href=#>Shakira</a>, <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and Madea movie mogul <a href=#>Tyler Perry</a> own islands but we can too. If vacating in Canada is more appealing Sweet Island in British Columbia has 3.3 acres and is $82,900.

Let’s take it up a notch. The Quassy Amusement Park in Connecticut can be rented out for a day if you bring 3,400 people at $25 a ticket. That is enough people to ask your friends and family to invite whoever they want. Unlike some amusement parks, it has a water park with slides, and raft rides to glide on the water. The Warrior roller coaster is one of the 25th&nbsp;top coasters in the world. When visitors get tired of being indoors, the Laser Maze Challenge activates after pressing a red button. Get your James Bond swag on to try and loop your way under lasers to win the game. When your guests want to chill out, lay on the amusement park's beach and play volleyball with your friends.

Think about it. When you want to impress the man or woman of your dreams, taking them on a helicopter ride will help you to land a second date. If a natural disaster is coming your way and you have a few days to prepare, knowing how to fly will come in handy. Depending on the aviation school, the cost to become a pilot can vary between $35,000 to $70,000 a year.

As you are finding it hard to balance a personal life with a job, the experience of hiring a professional cook is priceless. Most chefs request $20 to $30 per hour and if you hire an experienced professional for a year for 5 hours every day that is a $50,400 annual salary. Use the rest of your money to buy luxury food items and request their time when you need to throw a party. Can you imagine the time you can save with a chef in your kitchen? They can use recipes and make international foods you have never heard of before. If you like to cook, you can be creative by coming up with an original recipe or ask your chef to teach you how to make new desserts. With an on-call chef at your side, the sky is the limit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-own-a-franchise-cruise-agency><strong>10.

If you spend a lot of time by the water at your parent's cottage then owning a watersport product is an option to consider. A water jet pack levitates people up in the air at 30 feet high and moves 30 miles per hour. According to Hawaii Flight Adventures, it has "a 200-mile power marine engine." Fly like an eagle over the water after a hard day at work, on the weekend or when you want to impress your friends. The way it works is a pump is attached to the jet and gushes out water to help you rise to the sky. Two handles need to be pressed to start the engine. If it looks like an intimidating activity, wear a helmet and a swimming safety vest to keep you safe while you have fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-an-elaborate-play-ground-to-call-you-own><strong>7.

The United States alone has invested in 8,000 tons of gold. With that amount alone, you can retire your entire family if you decide to liquidate. Either way, economists are predicting that paper money will no longer be of value in the future and to get yourself on track, having commodities is essential.
