No autopsy was performed on Lance. To my knowledge, no medical examination of Lance during his lifetime ever indicated such conditions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-513654474.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The attorney also detailed the <a href=#>John Wick star’s</a> strict fitness regimen and attention to health as reasons for his skepticism of heart or coronary artery disease being the cause of his death. “Lance was the most physically fit person I’ve ever known,” Hornstein continued. “He exercised daily at his home gym, including extensive cardio work, and the availability of gym facilities was a contractual requirement for his work away from home. He ate as if a dietician was monitoring his every meal. The information appearing on the death certificate is wholly inconsistent with his lifestyle.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In conclusion, the attorney doubled down on his assertion that the information provided on Reddick’s death certificate is being questioned due to the lack of an autopsy. “On behalf of Stephanie Reddick, the death certificate information is not corroborated and is inconsistent with the facts known to the family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hornstein did not comment on whether Reddick will be cremated, as was listed on his death certificate and shared in previous reports.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Reddick, known for his roles on The Wire and Bosch, <a href=#>passed away on March 17</a> after collapsing in the backyard of his home in Studio City, Calif. He was 60 at the time of his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1169285080.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Gur6%2FEZqmenJSesKx5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6FloaqytMDIqKWenF2WwbW70aecsmVhZ4B1g5Nwa2xxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hm-inks-lease-for-42nd-fifth.html><span>←</span><span>H&amp;amp;M INKS LEASE FOR 42ND &amp;amp; FIFTH</span></a>
